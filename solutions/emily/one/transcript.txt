prompt 3 of 3:
You are going to analyze the sudoku you've just been given.
The analysis will come down to one thing, finding the candidate elements for each unfilled square.
To do this, examine the nine rows, the nine columns, and the nine blocks, and find the elements missing from each set.
Then, for each unfilled square (squares with a '0'), examine the elements missing from the row, column, and 3-by-3 block associated with that square, combine them into a set of common candidates, and check to see whether or not there is Exactly one candidate in that set. Everything else follows from that.



# Board State
Trying to play without vision is difficult, so I want you to follow a very specific format.
I want you to print out the current board state using the _exact_ format shown below (replace the example with the current sudoku).
We are also finding the missing elements of each set. So we are taking the current row, column, or block, and calculating the set-wise difference between that row, column, or block, and the digits 1-9 shown in all_digits.
Each block and its missing elements will (between them) exactly cover the digits from 1 to 9 with no duplicates, and with each number appearing exactly once.
## Rows
all_digits = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]

Print all nine rows and row_missing_elements using the format:
row: [row], row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([row]) = [row_missing_elements]

Examples:
first_row: [1,0,3,4,5,6,0,0,9], first_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([1,0,3,4,5,6,0,0,9]) = [2,7,8]
second_row: [4,5,6,7,8,9,1,2,3], second_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([4,5,6,7,8,9,1,2,3]) = []
third_row: [7,8,0,1,2,3,4,5,6], third_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([7,8,0,1,2,3,4,5,6]) = [9]
fourth_row: [2,3,4,5,6,7,8,0,1], fourth_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([2,3,4,5,6,7,8,0,1]) = [9]
fifth_row: [5,6,7,8,9,1,2,3,4], fifth_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([5,6,7,8,9,1,2,3,4]) = []
sixth_row: [8,9,1,2,0,4,5,6,7], sixth_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([8,9,1,2,0,4,5,6,7]) = [3]
seventh_row: [3,4,5,6,7,8,9,1,2], seventh_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([3,4,5,6,7,8,9,1,2]) = []
eighth_row: [6,0,8,9,1,2,3,0,5], eighth_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([6,0,8,9,1,2,3,0,5]) = [4,7]
ninth_row: [9,0,2,0,4,5,0,7,8], ninth_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([9,0,2,0,4,5,0,7,8]) = [1,3,6]


## Columns
all_digits = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]

Format:
column: [column], column_missing_elements: [all_digits].difference([column]) = [column_missing_elements]

Examples:
first_column: [1,4,7,2,5,8,3,6,9] first_column_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([1,4,7,2,5,8,3,6,9]) = []
second_column: [0,5,8,3,6,9,4,0,0] second_column_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([0,5,8,3,6,9,4,0,0]) = [1,2,7]
third_column: [3,6,0,4,7,1,5,8,2] third_column_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([3,6,0,4,7,1,5,8,2]) = [9]
fourth_column: 

## Blocks
all_digits = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]

Format:
block: (rows: rows in the block; columns: columns in the block):
[block]
block_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([block]) = [block_missing_elements]

Examples:
top_left_block: (rows: first_row, second_row, third_row; columns: first_column, second_column, third_column)
[[1,0,3],
[4,5,6],
[7,8,0]]
top_left_block_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([1,0,3,4,5,6,7,8,0]) = [2,9]

top_middle_block: (rows: first_row, second_row, third_row; columns: fourth_column, fifth_column, sixth_column)
[[4,5,6],
[7,8,9],
[1,2,3]]
top_middle_block_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([4,5,6,7,8,9,1,2,3]) = []

top_right_block: (rows: first_row, second_row, third_row; columns: seventh_column, eighth_column, ninth_column)
[[0,0,9],
[1,2,3],
[4,5,6]]
top_right_block_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([0,0,9,1,2,3,4,5,6]) = [7,8]

middle_left_block: (rows: fourth_row, fifth_row, sixth_row; columns: first_column, second_column, third_column)



# Finding and counting the zero elements
## The positions of the zeroes
For each row we do the following calculations:
row_unfilled_indices: [row].index(0) = [index of every '0' element in the row]
row_unfilled_positions: row_unfilled_indices.increment(1) = [each index incremented by 1]
row_unfilled_columns: the word versions of the positions of the zeroes

Use the following format:
first_row_unfilled_indices: [1,0,3,4,5,6,0,0,9].index(0) = [1,6,7]
first_row_unfilled_positions: first_row_unfilled_indices.increment(1) = [2,7,8]
first_row_unfilled_columns: second, seventh, eighth


## Calculate the number of unfilled squares
A simple one line calculation By Hand to get the total number of unfilled squares:
total_unfilled_squares = 3 + 0 + 1 + 1 + 0 + 1 + 0 + 2 + 3 = 11

Then we cap the number of squares to list:
number_of_squares_to_list = min(total_unfilled_squares, 17) = 11



# Candidate analysis
## Common candidates in each unfilled square
Go through each unfilled square and list the missing elements for the row, column, and block containing that square (use the row and column to get the correct block).
Calculate the elements that are in Both the row, AND the column. Make sure to find ALL of them.
Then calculate the elements that are in Both STEP_A (the previous result), AND the block. Make sure to find ALL of them.

Make sure to ONLY do unfilled squares, which we calculated in the section 'The positions of the zeroes'.
For each unfilled square we examine, we do the following calculations (example below):
STEP_A = row_missing_elements.intersection(column_missing_elements) = [elements in both row_missing_elements AND column_missing_elements]
STEP_B = STEP_A.intersection(block_missing_elements) = [elements in both STEP_A AND block_missing_elements]
common_missing_elements: [STEP_B]
FOUND: square(row, column) (print this line if there is Only one common_missing_element in that square, otherwise leave this line blank and keep going)

Example:
### first_row_unfilled_columns: second, seventh, eighth
#### 1 of {number_of_squares_to_list}
(first_row, second_column):
Using first_row_missing_elements, second_column_missing_elements, and top_left_block_missing_elements (do not list the elements here, just the set names)
STEP_A: [2,7,8].intersection([1,2,7]) = [2,7]
STEP_B: [2,7].intersection([2,9]) = [2]
common_missing_elements: [2]
FOUND: square(first_row, second_column) (If the square has one only one common_missing_element, also print "FOUND ONE: square(row, column)" like this, then keep going)

When we have done as many unfilled squares as specified by number_of_squares_to_list, we stop listing squares and print:
"Finished printing 17 out of 17 squares" (using appropriate numbers)

# Outputting the found squares
## Collating Results
For Every unfilled square that had ONLY one common element (marked with "FOUND: square(row, column)"), we list them below so they are all in one place.

FOUND: square(first_row, second_column)

Make sure to list ALL of them

If there where none, instead print "There were no unfilled squares with only one common_missing_element"


## Unbiased Results
Finally, for every square in the results, we need to list them in the following format:
square(first_row, second_column)
first_row_missing_elements = [2,7,8]
second_column_missing_elements = [1,2,7]
top_left_block_missing_elements = [2,7]

Note that neither of the output sections lists the common_missing_element found in that square. This is to allow unbiased verification of the results.

Make sure to list all of them

If there where none, instead print "There are no candidate squares"

Follow ALL instructions METHODICALLY and IN FULL. Your task is to calculate the possible candidate elements for the given cells, then to update the non-rejected cells of the given sudoku using the calculated candidate elements, then to shift the rows, and finally to output the updated and shifted sudoku. Once you begin you must complete ALL of these tasks BEFORE stopping. After receiving the full instructions you have ONLY one message to finish the task, as soon as you stop responding the final section of your response is sent to the next part of the process. Thus the final text you write MUST be the updated and shifted Sudoku, in the correct format, after ALL other sections have been completed. Begin as soon as you receive the full instruction set.

prompt 7 of 7:
# Task and background
- My previous message contains the last few hundred characters of a Sudoku analysis.
- You are examining the results in the "Unbiased Results" section of the previous message. Ignore all text before that section.
- The cells given in the section "Unbiased Results" are cells which were found to have only one possible candidate.
- However, the process which found the given cells will sometimes make mistakes, due to having to check so many cells at once.
- Your task is to use the given instructions to perform an independent verification or rejection of the given cells.
- Detailed instructions are provided below, but an overview is as follows:
    - Calculate the possible candidate elements for each cell using the method given below.
    - If a cell has multiple candidates, or fails some other given condition, reject that cell as a mistake made by the previous process.
- Complete all steps starting at STEP_ONE.


# STEP_ONE Extracting Previous Results
- Extract the results of the "Unbiased Results" section in the previous message.
- If there is no section marked "Unbiased Results" in the previous message, that means the start of it was cut off. In that case just start with the first complete cell you can see.
- Only take at most the first FOUR cells of the "Unbiased Results" section, as that's all the system can handle.
- Print the text from that section under the current heading "STEP_ONE Extracting Previous Results". Do not print the heading from the previous message.
- Note: When you print the text, change '_missing_elements' to '_candidates' for the row, column, and block for every cell. Everything else should remain the same.
- These cells will be used in STEP_TWO.


# STEP_TWO Calculating the candidates of each cell
- For each cell from STEP_ONE, use the following method to calculate the candidates of that cell.
- For each cell:
    - Loop through the digits 1 to 9
    - For each digit, count the number of times that digit appears in the row_candidates list, the column_candidates list, and the block_candidates lists.
    - On the same line, sum the row count, the column count, and the block count to get the total_count.
    - Most importantly, if the total_count is 3, immediately print "FOUND A THREE".
- At the end of each cell, find all the digits which had a total_count of 3 (marked by FOUND A THREE) and list them as the candidates of that cell.
- Everytime you complete a cell print "Cell {current cell number} of {number of cells} complete! {number of cells left} more to go!"
- Then move to the next cell until all are done.
- If there are more than 4 cells, cap the number to check at 4.

- Here is an example with the correct format:
## Cell 1 of {number of cells}
cell(first_row, second_column):
row = first_row_candidates = [1,2,4,6]
column = second_column_candidates = [2,5,6,7,8,9]
block = top_left_block_candidates = [1,2,3,4,6,7]

row.count(1) = 1, column.count(1) = 0, block.count(1) = 1, total_count(1) = 2
row.count(2) = 1, column.count(2) = 1, block.count(2) = 1, total_count(2) = 3 FOUND A THREE
row.count(3) = 0, column.count(3) = 0, block.count(3) = 1, total_count(3) = 1
row.count(4) = 1, column.count(4) = 0, block.count(4) = 1, total_count(4) = 2
row.count(5) = 0, column.count(5) = 1, block.count(5) = 0, total_count(5) = 1
row.count(6) = 1, column.count(6) = 1, block.count(6) = 1, total_count(6) = 3 FOUND A THREE
row.count(7) = 0, column.count(7) = 1, block.count(7) = 1, total_count(7) = 2
row.count(8) = 0, column.count(8) = 1, block.count(8) = 0, total_count(8) = 1
row.count(9) = 0, column.count(9) = 1, block.count(9) = 0, total_count(9) = 1

Confirmed candidates found for cell(first_row, second_column): [2,6]
Cell 1 of 3 complete! 2 more to go!!!

- After you have done All of the cells, list them in one place.
- Example:
## Candidates of the cells
cell(first_row, second_column): [2,6]
cell(second_row, eighth_column): [9]
cell(fourth_row, second_column): [1]

- Make sure to list All the cells, up to a maximum of 4


# STEP_THREE Checking the number of elements in each cell
- For each cell, count the number of elements in the candidates of that cell using .length().
- After each length, either print "length is 1, Passes" if the length is 1, or print "length is {length}, not 1, Rejected" if the length is Not one.
- Example:
cell(first_row, second_column): [2,6]
[2,6].length = number from 2
length is 2, not 1, Rejected

- After doing this for all the cells, list the cells which Passed, making sure Not to list any Rejected cells.
- Example:
## Passing Cells
cell(second_row, eighth_column): [9]
cell(fourth_row, second_column): [1]


# STEP_FOUR: Grouping Cells with Corresponding Rows
- Group each cell from the "Passing Cells" in STEP_THREE with their corresponding row from the current Sudoku. Do not update them yet.
- If there are no passing cells to update, print "There are no cells to update" and move to the next step.
- The current Sudoku is the second message I sent. Since it's so far back print it here (in the exact format it appears but without the output tags) to avoid confusing it with the examples.

- Example:
Current Sudoku:
{Current Sudoku Goes Here}

first_row: [0,3,0,0,8,0,4,9,0]
cell(first_row, fourth_column): [5]

fourth_row: [0,4,1,6,7,3,2,5,8]
cell(fourth_row, first_column): [9]

seventh_row: [2,0,4,0,0,0,0,8,0]
cell(seventh_row, eighth_column): [3]


# STEP_FIVE: Applying Cell Updates to Rows
- Now that the cells to update are cleanly grouped with the appropriate rows, confirm the column position and update each appropriate row.
- However, and this is VITAL: If the column position does NOT have a zero, IMMEDIATELY reject that cell and move on to the next.

- Example:
first_row: [0,3,0,0,8,0,4,9,0]
cell(first_row, fourth_column): [5]
The 4th position of the first_row is 0, so we can proceed.
Updating the value in the 4th position of the first_row:
updated_first_row: [0,3,0,5,8,0,4,9,0]

fourth_row: [0,4,1,6,7,3,2,5,8]
cell(fourth_row, first_column): [9]
The 1st position of the fourth_row is 0, so we can proceed.
Updating the value in the 1st position of the fourth_row:
updated_fourth_row: [9,4,1,6,7,3,2,5,8]

seventh_row: [2,0,4,0,0,0,0,8,0]
cell(seventh_row, eighth_column): [3]
The 8th position of the seventh_row is 8, WHICH IS NOT 0. This cell is rejected and will not be updated.


# STEP_SIX: Printing the Updated Sudoku
- Now print the Sudoku using the updated rows
- Specify the rows to update first to be sure they aren't forgotten. Do not include any rejected cells.

- Example:
The rows to update are first and fourth
updated_first_row: [0,3,0,5,8,0,4,9,0]
second_row: [0,9,2,0,4,1,0,0,0]
third_row: [0,6,0,7,0,9,0,0,5]
updated_fourth_row: [9,4,1,6,7,3,2,5,8]
fifth_row: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3]
sixth_row: [7,8,0,0,5,2,6,0,0]
seventh_row: [2,0,4,0,0,0,0,8,0]
eighth_row: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,4]
ninth_row: [0,1,0,0,3,0,0,2,0]


# Standardizing Row Names in the Updated Sudoku
- Print the Sudoku you just updated, but with the the original NAMES for the rows.
- Make sure the elements are from the UPDATED Sudoku in STEP_SIX.
- As there is now an old and an updated Sudoku, both of which look similar, write the following above the updated Sudoku
"The rows to fix the NAMES of are {rows to change}. The elements are the same as in STEP_SIX."

- Example:
The rows to fix the NAMES of are first and fourth. The elements are the same as in STEP_SIX.

first_row: [0,3,0,5,8,0,4,9,0]
second_row: [0,9,2,0,4,1,0,0,0]
third_row: [0,6,0,7,0,9,0,0,5]
fourth_row: [9,4,1,6,7,3,2,5,8]
fifth_row: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3]
sixth_row: [7,8,0,0,5,2,6,0,0]
seventh_row: [2,0,4,0,0,0,0,8,0]
eighth_row: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,4]
ninth_row: [0,1,0,0,3,0,0,2,0]

- Do not modify any other names in the Sudoku.


# STEP_SEVEN: Shifting the Rows of the Sudoku
- Before you output the Sudoku, the top three rows need to shifted to the bottom, like cutting a deck of cards.
- The rows to be in the order: fourth, fifth, sixth, seventh, eighth, ninth, first, second, third.

- Example:
fourth_row: [9,4,1,6,7,3,2,5,8]
fifth_row: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3]
sixth_row: [7,8,0,0,5,2,6,0,0]
seventh_row: [2,0,4,0,0,0,0,8,0]
eighth_row: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,4]
ninth_row: [0,1,0,0,3,0,0,2,0]
first_row: [0,3,0,5,8,0,4,9,0]
second_row: [0,9,2,0,4,1,0,0,0]
third_row: [0,6,0,7,0,9,0,0,5]


# STEP_EIGHT Fixing the Row Names and Outputting the Sudoku
- WITHOUT moving the elements of the Sudoku, standardize the row names.
- Also surround the Sudoku in output tags to clearly mark it as the output.
- Do not write ANYTHING after the closing output tag, as it will interfere with the system extracting your output.

- Example:
<Output>
first_row: [9,4,1,6,7,3,2,5,8]
second_row: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3]
third_row: [7,8,0,0,5,2,6,0,0]
fourth_row: [2,0,4,0,0,0,0,8,0]
fifth_row: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,4]
sixth_row: [0,1,0,0,3,0,0,2,0]
seventh_row: [0,3,0,5,8,0,4,9,0]
eighth_row: [0,9,2,0,4,1,0,0,0]
ninth_row: [0,6,0,7,0,9,0,0,5]
</Output>


# Final notes
- Ensure all outputs are clearly labeled using the simple headers provided in the instructions.
- Do not use code blocks. Just plain text with the headers in the instructions is fine.
- Stop ONLY after completing STEP_EIGHT, writing NOTHING ELSE after you write the final closing output tag.
- Begin

prompt 3 of 3:
You are going to analyze the sudoku you've just been given.
The analysis will come down to one thing, finding the candidate elements for each unfilled square.
To do this, examine the nine rows, the nine columns, and the nine blocks, and find the elements missing from each set.
Then, for each unfilled square (squares with a '0'), examine the elements missing from the row, column, and 3-by-3 block associated with that square, combine them into a set of common candidates, and check to see whether or not there is Exactly one candidate in that set. Everything else follows from that.



# Board State
Trying to play without vision is difficult, so I want you to follow a very specific format.
I want you to print out the current board state using the _exact_ format shown below (replace the example with the current sudoku).
We are also finding the missing elements of each set. So we are taking the current row, column, or block, and calculating the set-wise difference between that row, column, or block, and the digits 1-9 shown in all_digits.
Each block and its missing elements will (between them) exactly cover the digits from 1 to 9 with no duplicates, and with each number appearing exactly once.
## Rows
all_digits = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]

Print all nine rows and row_missing_elements using the format:
row: [row], row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([row]) = [row_missing_elements]

Examples:
first_row: [1,0,3,4,5,6,0,0,9], first_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([1,0,3,4,5,6,0,0,9]) = [2,7,8]
second_row: [4,5,6,7,8,9,1,2,3], second_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([4,5,6,7,8,9,1,2,3]) = []
third_row: [7,8,0,1,2,3,4,5,6], third_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([7,8,0,1,2,3,4,5,6]) = [9]
fourth_row: [2,3,4,5,6,7,8,0,1], fourth_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([2,3,4,5,6,7,8,0,1]) = [9]
fifth_row: [5,6,7,8,9,1,2,3,4], fifth_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([5,6,7,8,9,1,2,3,4]) = []
sixth_row: [8,9,1,2,0,4,5,6,7], sixth_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([8,9,1,2,0,4,5,6,7]) = [3]
seventh_row: [3,4,5,6,7,8,9,1,2], seventh_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([3,4,5,6,7,8,9,1,2]) = []
eighth_row: [6,0,8,9,1,2,3,0,5], eighth_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([6,0,8,9,1,2,3,0,5]) = [4,7]
ninth_row: [9,0,2,0,4,5,0,7,8], ninth_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([9,0,2,0,4,5,0,7,8]) = [1,3,6]


## Columns
all_digits = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]

Format:
column: [column], column_missing_elements: [all_digits].difference([column]) = [column_missing_elements]

Examples:
first_column: [1,4,7,2,5,8,3,6,9] first_column_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([1,4,7,2,5,8,3,6,9]) = []
second_column: [0,5,8,3,6,9,4,0,0] second_column_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([0,5,8,3,6,9,4,0,0]) = [1,2,7]
third_column: [3,6,0,4,7,1,5,8,2] third_column_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([3,6,0,4,7,1,5,8,2]) = [9]
fourth_column: 

## Blocks
all_digits = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]

Format:
block: (rows: rows in the block; columns: columns in the block):
[block]
block_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([block]) = [block_missing_elements]

Examples:
top_left_block: (rows: first_row, second_row, third_row; columns: first_column, second_column, third_column)
[[1,0,3],
[4,5,6],
[7,8,0]]
top_left_block_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([1,0,3,4,5,6,7,8,0]) = [2,9]

top_middle_block: (rows: first_row, second_row, third_row; columns: fourth_column, fifth_column, sixth_column)
[[4,5,6],
[7,8,9],
[1,2,3]]
top_middle_block_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([4,5,6,7,8,9,1,2,3]) = []

top_right_block: (rows: first_row, second_row, third_row; columns: seventh_column, eighth_column, ninth_column)
[[0,0,9],
[1,2,3],
[4,5,6]]
top_right_block_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([0,0,9,1,2,3,4,5,6]) = [7,8]

middle_left_block: (rows: fourth_row, fifth_row, sixth_row; columns: first_column, second_column, third_column)



# Finding and counting the zero elements
## The positions of the zeroes
For each row we do the following calculations:
row_unfilled_indices: [row].index(0) = [index of every '0' element in the row]
row_unfilled_positions: row_unfilled_indices.increment(1) = [each index incremented by 1]
row_unfilled_columns: the word versions of the positions of the zeroes

Use the following format:
first_row_unfilled_indices: [1,0,3,4,5,6,0,0,9].index(0) = [1,6,7]
first_row_unfilled_positions: first_row_unfilled_indices.increment(1) = [2,7,8]
first_row_unfilled_columns: second, seventh, eighth


## Calculate the number of unfilled squares
A simple one line calculation By Hand to get the total number of unfilled squares:
total_unfilled_squares = 3 + 0 + 1 + 1 + 0 + 1 + 0 + 2 + 3 = 11

Then we cap the number of squares to list:
number_of_squares_to_list = min(total_unfilled_squares, 17) = 11



# Candidate analysis
## Common candidates in each unfilled square
Go through each unfilled square and list the missing elements for the row, column, and block containing that square (use the row and column to get the correct block).
Calculate the elements that are in Both the row, AND the column. Make sure to find ALL of them.
Then calculate the elements that are in Both STEP_A (the previous result), AND the block. Make sure to find ALL of them.

Make sure to ONLY do unfilled squares, which we calculated in the section 'The positions of the zeroes'.
For each unfilled square we examine, we do the following calculations (example below):
STEP_A = row_missing_elements.intersection(column_missing_elements) = [elements in both row_missing_elements AND column_missing_elements]
STEP_B = STEP_A.intersection(block_missing_elements) = [elements in both STEP_A AND block_missing_elements]
common_missing_elements: [STEP_B]
FOUND: square(row, column) (print this line if there is Only one common_missing_element in that square, otherwise leave this line blank and keep going)

Example:
### first_row_unfilled_columns: second, seventh, eighth
#### 1 of {number_of_squares_to_list}
(first_row, second_column):
Using first_row_missing_elements, second_column_missing_elements, and top_left_block_missing_elements (do not list the elements here, just the set names)
STEP_A: [2,7,8].intersection([1,2,7]) = [2,7]
STEP_B: [2,7].intersection([2,9]) = [2]
common_missing_elements: [2]
FOUND: square(first_row, second_column) (If the square has one only one common_missing_element, also print "FOUND ONE: square(row, column)" like this, then keep going)

When we have done as many unfilled squares as specified by number_of_squares_to_list, we stop listing squares and print:
"Finished printing 17 out of 17 squares" (using appropriate numbers)

# Outputting the found squares
## Collating Results
For Every unfilled square that had ONLY one common element (marked with "FOUND: square(row, column)"), we list them below so they are all in one place.

FOUND: square(first_row, second_column)

Make sure to list ALL of them

If there where none, instead print "There were no unfilled squares with only one common_missing_element"


## Unbiased Results
Finally, for every square in the results, we need to list them in the following format:
square(first_row, second_column)
first_row_missing_elements = [2,7,8]
second_column_missing_elements = [1,2,7]
top_left_block_missing_elements = [2,7]

Note that neither of the output sections lists the common_missing_element found in that square. This is to allow unbiased verification of the results.

Make sure to list all of them

If there where none, instead print "There are no candidate squares"

Follow ALL instructions METHODICALLY and IN FULL. Your task is to calculate the possible candidate elements for the given cells, then to update the non-rejected cells of the given sudoku using the calculated candidate elements, then to shift the rows, and finally to output the updated and shifted sudoku. Once you begin you must complete ALL of these tasks BEFORE stopping. After receiving the full instructions you have ONLY one message to finish the task, as soon as you stop responding the final section of your response is sent to the next part of the process. Thus the final text you write MUST be the updated and shifted Sudoku, in the correct format, after ALL other sections have been completed. Begin as soon as you receive the full instruction set.

prompt 7 of 7:
# Task and background
- My previous message contains the last few hundred characters of a Sudoku analysis.
- You are examining the results in the "Unbiased Results" section of the previous message. Ignore all text before that section.
- The cells given in the section "Unbiased Results" are cells which were found to have only one possible candidate.
- However, the process which found the given cells will sometimes make mistakes, due to having to check so many cells at once.
- Your task is to use the given instructions to perform an independent verification or rejection of the given cells.
- Detailed instructions are provided below, but an overview is as follows:
    - Calculate the possible candidate elements for each cell using the method given below.
    - If a cell has multiple candidates, or fails some other given condition, reject that cell as a mistake made by the previous process.
- Complete all steps starting at STEP_ONE.


# STEP_ONE Extracting Previous Results
- Extract the results of the "Unbiased Results" section in the previous message.
- If there is no section marked "Unbiased Results" in the previous message, that means the start of it was cut off. In that case just start with the first complete cell you can see.
- Only take at most the first FOUR cells of the "Unbiased Results" section, as that's all the system can handle.
- Print the text from that section under the current heading "STEP_ONE Extracting Previous Results". Do not print the heading from the previous message.
- Note: When you print the text, change '_missing_elements' to '_candidates' for the row, column, and block for every cell. Everything else should remain the same.
- These cells will be used in STEP_TWO.


# STEP_TWO Calculating the candidates of each cell
- For each cell from STEP_ONE, use the following method to calculate the candidates of that cell.
- For each cell:
    - Loop through the digits 1 to 9
    - For each digit, count the number of times that digit appears in the row_candidates list, the column_candidates list, and the block_candidates lists.
    - On the same line, sum the row count, the column count, and the block count to get the total_count.
    - Most importantly, if the total_count is 3, immediately print "FOUND A THREE".
- At the end of each cell, find all the digits which had a total_count of 3 (marked by FOUND A THREE) and list them as the candidates of that cell.
- Everytime you complete a cell print "Cell {current cell number} of {number of cells} complete! {number of cells left} more to go!"
- Then move to the next cell until all are done.
- If there are more than 4 cells, cap the number to check at 4.

- Here is an example with the correct format:
## Cell 1 of {number of cells}
cell(first_row, second_column):
row = first_row_candidates = [1,2,4,6]
column = second_column_candidates = [2,5,6,7,8,9]
block = top_left_block_candidates = [1,2,3,4,6,7]

row.count(1) = 1, column.count(1) = 0, block.count(1) = 1, total_count(1) = 2
row.count(2) = 1, column.count(2) = 1, block.count(2) = 1, total_count(2) = 3 FOUND A THREE
row.count(3) = 0, column.count(3) = 0, block.count(3) = 1, total_count(3) = 1
row.count(4) = 1, column.count(4) = 0, block.count(4) = 1, total_count(4) = 2
row.count(5) = 0, column.count(5) = 1, block.count(5) = 0, total_count(5) = 1
row.count(6) = 1, column.count(6) = 1, block.count(6) = 1, total_count(6) = 3 FOUND A THREE
row.count(7) = 0, column.count(7) = 1, block.count(7) = 1, total_count(7) = 2
row.count(8) = 0, column.count(8) = 1, block.count(8) = 0, total_count(8) = 1
row.count(9) = 0, column.count(9) = 1, block.count(9) = 0, total_count(9) = 1

Confirmed candidates found for cell(first_row, second_column): [2,6]
Cell 1 of 3 complete! 2 more to go!!!

- After you have done All of the cells, list them in one place.
- Example:
## Candidates of the cells
cell(first_row, second_column): [2,6]
cell(second_row, eighth_column): [9]
cell(fourth_row, second_column): [1]

- Make sure to list All the cells, up to a maximum of 4


# STEP_THREE Checking the number of elements in each cell
- For each cell, count the number of elements in the candidates of that cell using .length().
- After each length, either print "length is 1, Passes" if the length is 1, or print "length is {length}, not 1, Rejected" if the length is Not one.
- Example:
cell(first_row, second_column): [2,6]
[2,6].length = number from 2
length is 2, not 1, Rejected

- After doing this for all the cells, list the cells which Passed, making sure Not to list any Rejected cells.
- Example:
## Passing Cells
cell(second_row, eighth_column): [9]
cell(fourth_row, second_column): [1]


# STEP_FOUR: Grouping Cells with Corresponding Rows
- Group each cell from the "Passing Cells" in STEP_THREE with their corresponding row from the current Sudoku. Do not update them yet.
- If there are no passing cells to update, print "There are no cells to update" and move to the next step.
- The current Sudoku is the second message I sent. Since it's so far back print it here (in the exact format it appears but without the output tags) to avoid confusing it with the examples.

- Example:
Current Sudoku:
{Current Sudoku Goes Here}

first_row: [0,3,0,0,8,0,4,9,0]
cell(first_row, fourth_column): [5]

fourth_row: [0,4,1,6,7,3,2,5,8]
cell(fourth_row, first_column): [9]

seventh_row: [2,0,4,0,0,0,0,8,0]
cell(seventh_row, eighth_column): [3]


# STEP_FIVE: Applying Cell Updates to Rows
- Now that the cells to update are cleanly grouped with the appropriate rows, confirm the column position and update each appropriate row.
- However, and this is VITAL: If the column position does NOT have a zero, IMMEDIATELY reject that cell and move on to the next.

- Example:
first_row: [0,3,0,0,8,0,4,9,0]
cell(first_row, fourth_column): [5]
The 4th position of the first_row is 0, so we can proceed.
Updating the value in the 4th position of the first_row:
updated_first_row: [0,3,0,5,8,0,4,9,0]

fourth_row: [0,4,1,6,7,3,2,5,8]
cell(fourth_row, first_column): [9]
The 1st position of the fourth_row is 0, so we can proceed.
Updating the value in the 1st position of the fourth_row:
updated_fourth_row: [9,4,1,6,7,3,2,5,8]

seventh_row: [2,0,4,0,0,0,0,8,0]
cell(seventh_row, eighth_column): [3]
The 8th position of the seventh_row is 8, WHICH IS NOT 0. This cell is rejected and will not be updated.


# STEP_SIX: Printing the Updated Sudoku
- Now print the Sudoku using the updated rows
- Specify the rows to update first to be sure they aren't forgotten. Do not include any rejected cells.

- Example:
The rows to update are first and fourth
updated_first_row: [0,3,0,5,8,0,4,9,0]
second_row: [0,9,2,0,4,1,0,0,0]
third_row: [0,6,0,7,0,9,0,0,5]
updated_fourth_row: [9,4,1,6,7,3,2,5,8]
fifth_row: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3]
sixth_row: [7,8,0,0,5,2,6,0,0]
seventh_row: [2,0,4,0,0,0,0,8,0]
eighth_row: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,4]
ninth_row: [0,1,0,0,3,0,0,2,0]


# Standardizing Row Names in the Updated Sudoku
- Print the Sudoku you just updated, but with the the original NAMES for the rows.
- Make sure the elements are from the UPDATED Sudoku in STEP_SIX.
- As there is now an old and an updated Sudoku, both of which look similar, write the following above the updated Sudoku
"The rows to fix the NAMES of are {rows to change}. The elements are the same as in STEP_SIX."

- Example:
The rows to fix the NAMES of are first and fourth. The elements are the same as in STEP_SIX.

first_row: [0,3,0,5,8,0,4,9,0]
second_row: [0,9,2,0,4,1,0,0,0]
third_row: [0,6,0,7,0,9,0,0,5]
fourth_row: [9,4,1,6,7,3,2,5,8]
fifth_row: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3]
sixth_row: [7,8,0,0,5,2,6,0,0]
seventh_row: [2,0,4,0,0,0,0,8,0]
eighth_row: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,4]
ninth_row: [0,1,0,0,3,0,0,2,0]

- Do not modify any other names in the Sudoku.


# STEP_SEVEN: Shifting the Rows of the Sudoku
- Before you output the Sudoku, the top three rows need to shifted to the bottom, like cutting a deck of cards.
- The rows to be in the order: fourth, fifth, sixth, seventh, eighth, ninth, first, second, third.

- Example:
fourth_row: [9,4,1,6,7,3,2,5,8]
fifth_row: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3]
sixth_row: [7,8,0,0,5,2,6,0,0]
seventh_row: [2,0,4,0,0,0,0,8,0]
eighth_row: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,4]
ninth_row: [0,1,0,0,3,0,0,2,0]
first_row: [0,3,0,5,8,0,4,9,0]
second_row: [0,9,2,0,4,1,0,0,0]
third_row: [0,6,0,7,0,9,0,0,5]


# STEP_EIGHT Fixing the Row Names and Outputting the Sudoku
- WITHOUT moving the elements of the Sudoku, standardize the row names.
- Also surround the Sudoku in output tags to clearly mark it as the output.
- Do not write ANYTHING after the closing output tag, as it will interfere with the system extracting your output.

- Example:
<Output>
first_row: [9,4,1,6,7,3,2,5,8]
second_row: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3]
third_row: [7,8,0,0,5,2,6,0,0]
fourth_row: [2,0,4,0,0,0,0,8,0]
fifth_row: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,4]
sixth_row: [0,1,0,0,3,0,0,2,0]
seventh_row: [0,3,0,5,8,0,4,9,0]
eighth_row: [0,9,2,0,4,1,0,0,0]
ninth_row: [0,6,0,7,0,9,0,0,5]
</Output>


# Final notes
- Ensure all outputs are clearly labeled using the simple headers provided in the instructions.
- Do not use code blocks. Just plain text with the headers in the instructions is fine.
- Stop ONLY after completing STEP_EIGHT, writing NOTHING ELSE after you write the final closing output tag.
- Begin

prompt 3 of 3:
You are going to analyze the sudoku you've just been given.
The analysis will come down to one thing, finding the candidate elements for each unfilled square.
To do this, examine the nine rows, the nine columns, and the nine blocks, and find the elements missing from each set.
Then, for each unfilled square (squares with a '0'), examine the elements missing from the row, column, and 3-by-3 block associated with that square, combine them into a set of common candidates, and check to see whether or not there is Exactly one candidate in that set. Everything else follows from that.



# Board State
Trying to play without vision is difficult, so I want you to follow a very specific format.
I want you to print out the current board state using the _exact_ format shown below (replace the example with the current sudoku).
We are also finding the missing elements of each set. So we are taking the current row, column, or block, and calculating the set-wise difference between that row, column, or block, and the digits 1-9 shown in all_digits.
Each block and its missing elements will (between them) exactly cover the digits from 1 to 9 with no duplicates, and with each number appearing exactly once.
## Rows
all_digits = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]

Print all nine rows and row_missing_elements using the format:
row: [row], row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([row]) = [row_missing_elements]

Examples:
first_row: [1,0,3,4,5,6,0,0,9], first_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([1,0,3,4,5,6,0,0,9]) = [2,7,8]
second_row: [4,5,6,7,8,9,1,2,3], second_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([4,5,6,7,8,9,1,2,3]) = []
third_row: [7,8,0,1,2,3,4,5,6], third_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([7,8,0,1,2,3,4,5,6]) = [9]
fourth_row: [2,3,4,5,6,7,8,0,1], fourth_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([2,3,4,5,6,7,8,0,1]) = [9]
fifth_row: [5,6,7,8,9,1,2,3,4], fifth_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([5,6,7,8,9,1,2,3,4]) = []
sixth_row: [8,9,1,2,0,4,5,6,7], sixth_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([8,9,1,2,0,4,5,6,7]) = [3]
seventh_row: [3,4,5,6,7,8,9,1,2], seventh_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([3,4,5,6,7,8,9,1,2]) = []
eighth_row: [6,0,8,9,1,2,3,0,5], eighth_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([6,0,8,9,1,2,3,0,5]) = [4,7]
ninth_row: [9,0,2,0,4,5,0,7,8], ninth_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([9,0,2,0,4,5,0,7,8]) = [1,3,6]


## Columns
all_digits = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]

Format:
column: [column], column_missing_elements: [all_digits].difference([column]) = [column_missing_elements]

Examples:
first_column: [1,4,7,2,5,8,3,6,9] first_column_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([1,4,7,2,5,8,3,6,9]) = []
second_column: [0,5,8,3,6,9,4,0,0] second_column_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([0,5,8,3,6,9,4,0,0]) = [1,2,7]
third_column: [3,6,0,4,7,1,5,8,2] third_column_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([3,6,0,4,7,1,5,8,2]) = [9]
fourth_column: 

## Blocks
all_digits = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]

Format:
block: (rows: rows in the block; columns: columns in the block):
[block]
block_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([block]) = [block_missing_elements]

Examples:
top_left_block: (rows: first_row, second_row, third_row; columns: first_column, second_column, third_column)
[[1,0,3],
[4,5,6],
[7,8,0]]
top_left_block_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([1,0,3,4,5,6,7,8,0]) = [2,9]

top_middle_block: (rows: first_row, second_row, third_row; columns: fourth_column, fifth_column, sixth_column)
[[4,5,6],
[7,8,9],
[1,2,3]]
top_middle_block_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([4,5,6,7,8,9,1,2,3]) = []

top_right_block: (rows: first_row, second_row, third_row; columns: seventh_column, eighth_column, ninth_column)
[[0,0,9],
[1,2,3],
[4,5,6]]
top_right_block_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([0,0,9,1,2,3,4,5,6]) = [7,8]

middle_left_block: (rows: fourth_row, fifth_row, sixth_row; columns: first_column, second_column, third_column)



# Finding and counting the zero elements
## The positions of the zeroes
For each row we do the following calculations:
row_unfilled_indices: [row].index(0) = [index of every '0' element in the row]
row_unfilled_positions: row_unfilled_indices.increment(1) = [each index incremented by 1]
row_unfilled_columns: the word versions of the positions of the zeroes

Use the following format:
first_row_unfilled_indices: [1,0,3,4,5,6,0,0,9].index(0) = [1,6,7]
first_row_unfilled_positions: first_row_unfilled_indices.increment(1) = [2,7,8]
first_row_unfilled_columns: second, seventh, eighth


## Calculate the number of unfilled squares
A simple one line calculation By Hand to get the total number of unfilled squares:
total_unfilled_squares = 3 + 0 + 1 + 1 + 0 + 1 + 0 + 2 + 3 = 11

Then we cap the number of squares to list:
number_of_squares_to_list = min(total_unfilled_squares, 17) = 11



# Candidate analysis
## Common candidates in each unfilled square
Go through each unfilled square and list the missing elements for the row, column, and block containing that square (use the row and column to get the correct block).
Calculate the elements that are in Both the row, AND the column. Make sure to find ALL of them.
Then calculate the elements that are in Both STEP_A (the previous result), AND the block. Make sure to find ALL of them.

Make sure to ONLY do unfilled squares, which we calculated in the section 'The positions of the zeroes'.
For each unfilled square we examine, we do the following calculations (example below):
STEP_A = row_missing_elements.intersection(column_missing_elements) = [elements in both row_missing_elements AND column_missing_elements]
STEP_B = STEP_A.intersection(block_missing_elements) = [elements in both STEP_A AND block_missing_elements]
common_missing_elements: [STEP_B]
FOUND: square(row, column) (print this line if there is Only one common_missing_element in that square, otherwise leave this line blank and keep going)

Example:
### first_row_unfilled_columns: second, seventh, eighth
#### 1 of {number_of_squares_to_list}
(first_row, second_column):
Using first_row_missing_elements, second_column_missing_elements, and top_left_block_missing_elements (do not list the elements here, just the set names)
STEP_A: [2,7,8].intersection([1,2,7]) = [2,7]
STEP_B: [2,7].intersection([2,9]) = [2]
common_missing_elements: [2]
FOUND: square(first_row, second_column) (If the square has one only one common_missing_element, also print "FOUND ONE: square(row, column)" like this, then keep going)

When we have done as many unfilled squares as specified by number_of_squares_to_list, we stop listing squares and print:
"Finished printing 17 out of 17 squares" (using appropriate numbers)

# Outputting the found squares
## Collating Results
For Every unfilled square that had ONLY one common element (marked with "FOUND: square(row, column)"), we list them below so they are all in one place.

FOUND: square(first_row, second_column)

Make sure to list ALL of them

If there where none, instead print "There were no unfilled squares with only one common_missing_element"


## Unbiased Results
Finally, for every square in the results, we need to list them in the following format:
square(first_row, second_column)
first_row_missing_elements = [2,7,8]
second_column_missing_elements = [1,2,7]
top_left_block_missing_elements = [2,7]

Note that neither of the output sections lists the common_missing_element found in that square. This is to allow unbiased verification of the results.

Make sure to list all of them

If there where none, instead print "There are no candidate squares"

prompt 7 of 7:
# Task and background
- My previous message contains the last few hundred characters of a Sudoku analysis.
- You are examining the results in the "Unbiased Results" section of the previous message. Ignore all text before that section.
- The cells given in the section "Unbiased Results" are cells which were found to have only one possible candidate.
- However, the process which found the given cells will sometimes make mistakes, due to having to check so many cells at once.
- Your task is to use the given instructions to perform an independent verification or rejection of the given cells.
- Detailed instructions are provided below, but an overview is as follows:
    - Calculate the possible candidate elements for each cell using the method given below.
    - If a cell has multiple candidates, or fails some other given condition, reject that cell as a mistake made by the previous process.
- Complete all steps starting at STEP_ONE.


# STEP_ONE Extracting Previous Results
- Extract the results of the "Unbiased Results" section in the previous message.
- If there is no section marked "Unbiased Results" in the previous message, that means the start of it was cut off. In that case just start with the first complete cell you can see.
- Only take at most the first FOUR cells of the "Unbiased Results" section, as that's all the system can handle.
- Print the text from that section under the current heading "STEP_ONE Extracting Previous Results". Do not print the heading from the previous message.
- Note: When you print the text, change '_missing_elements' to '_candidates' for the row, column, and block for every cell. Everything else should remain the same.
- These cells will be used in STEP_TWO.


# STEP_TWO Calculating the candidates of each cell
- For each cell from STEP_ONE, use the following method to calculate the candidates of that cell.
- For each cell:
    - Loop through the digits 1 to 9
    - For each digit, count the number of times that digit appears in the row_candidates list, the column_candidates list, and the block_candidates lists.
    - On the same line, sum the row count, the column count, and the block count to get the total_count.
    - Most importantly, if the total_count is 3, immediately print "FOUND A THREE".
- At the end of each cell, find all the digits which had a total_count of 3 (marked by FOUND A THREE) and list them as the candidates of that cell.
- Everytime you complete a cell print "Cell {current cell number} of {number of cells} complete! {number of cells left} more to go!"
- Then move to the next cell until all are done.
- If there are more than 4 cells, cap the number to check at 4.

- Here is an example with the correct format:
## Cell 1 of {number of cells}
cell(first_row, second_column):
row = first_row_candidates = [1,2,4,6]
column = second_column_candidates = [2,5,6,7,8,9]
block = top_left_block_candidates = [1,2,3,4,6,7]

row.count(1) = 1, column.count(1) = 0, block.count(1) = 1, total_count(1) = 2
row.count(2) = 1, column.count(2) = 1, block.count(2) = 1, total_count(2) = 3 FOUND A THREE
row.count(3) = 0, column.count(3) = 0, block.count(3) = 1, total_count(3) = 1
row.count(4) = 1, column.count(4) = 0, block.count(4) = 1, total_count(4) = 2
row.count(5) = 0, column.count(5) = 1, block.count(5) = 0, total_count(5) = 1
row.count(6) = 1, column.count(6) = 1, block.count(6) = 1, total_count(6) = 3 FOUND A THREE
row.count(7) = 0, column.count(7) = 1, block.count(7) = 1, total_count(7) = 2
row.count(8) = 0, column.count(8) = 1, block.count(8) = 0, total_count(8) = 1
row.count(9) = 0, column.count(9) = 1, block.count(9) = 0, total_count(9) = 1

Confirmed candidates found for cell(first_row, second_column): [2,6]
Cell 1 of 3 complete! 2 more to go!!!

- After you have done All of the cells, list them in one place.
- Example:
## Candidates of the cells
cell(first_row, second_column): [2,6]
cell(second_row, eighth_column): [9]
cell(fourth_row, second_column): [1]

- Make sure to list All the cells, up to a maximum of 4


# STEP_THREE Checking the number of elements in each cell
- For each cell, count the number of elements in the candidates of that cell using .length().
- After each length, either print "length is 1, Passes" if the length is 1, or print "length is {length}, not 1, Rejected" if the length is Not one.
- Example:
cell(first_row, second_column): [2,6]
[2,6].length = number from 2
length is 2, not 1, Rejected

- After doing this for all the cells, list the cells which Passed, making sure Not to list any Rejected cells.
- Example:
## Passing Cells
cell(second_row, eighth_column): [9]
cell(fourth_row, second_column): [1]


# STEP_FOUR: Grouping Cells with Corresponding Rows
- Group each cell from the "Passing Cells" in STEP_THREE with their corresponding row from the current Sudoku. Do not update them yet.
- If there are no passing cells to update, print "There are no cells to update" and move to the next step.
- The current Sudoku is the second message I sent. Since it's so far back print it here (in the exact format it appears but without the output tags) to avoid confusing it with the examples.

- Example:
Current Sudoku:
{Current Sudoku Goes Here}

first_row: [0,3,0,0,8,0,4,9,0]
cell(first_row, fourth_column): [5]

fourth_row: [0,4,1,6,7,3,2,5,8]
cell(fourth_row, first_column): [9]

seventh_row: [2,0,4,0,0,0,0,8,0]
cell(seventh_row, eighth_column): [3]


# STEP_FIVE: Applying Cell Updates to Rows
- Now that the cells to update are cleanly grouped with the appropriate rows, confirm the column position and update each appropriate row.
- However, and this is VITAL: If the column position does NOT have a zero, IMMEDIATELY reject that cell and move on to the next.

- Example:
first_row: [0,3,0,0,8,0,4,9,0]
cell(first_row, fourth_column): [5]
The 4th position of the first_row is 0, so we can proceed.
Updating the value in the 4th position of the first_row:
updated_first_row: [0,3,0,5,8,0,4,9,0]

fourth_row: [0,4,1,6,7,3,2,5,8]
cell(fourth_row, first_column): [9]
The 1st position of the fourth_row is 0, so we can proceed.
Updating the value in the 1st position of the fourth_row:
updated_fourth_row: [9,4,1,6,7,3,2,5,8]

seventh_row: [2,0,4,0,0,0,0,8,0]
cell(seventh_row, eighth_column): [3]
The 8th position of the seventh_row is 8, WHICH IS NOT 0. This cell is rejected and will not be updated.


# STEP_SIX: Printing the Updated Sudoku
- Now print the Sudoku using the updated rows
- Specify the rows to update first to be sure they aren't forgotten. Do not include any rejected cells.

- Example:

# Standardizing Row Names in the Updated Sudoku
- Print the Sudoku you just updated, but with the the original NAMES for the rows.
- Make sure the elements are from the UPDATED Sudoku in STEP_SIX.
- As there is now an old and an updated Sudoku, both of which look similar, write the following above the updated Sudoku
"The rows to fix the NAMES of are {rows to change}. The elements are the same as in STEP_SIX."

- Example:
The rows to fix the NAMES of are first and fourth. The elements are the same as in STEP_SIX.

first_row: [0,3,0,5,8,0,4,9,0]
second_row: [0,9,2,0,4,1,0,0,0]
third_row: [0,6,0,7,0,9,0,0,5]
fourth_row: [9,4,1,6,7,3,2,5,8]
fifth_row: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3]
sixth_row: [7,8,0,0,5,2,6,0,0]
seventh_row: [2,0,4,0,0,0,0,8,0]
eighth_row: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,4]
ninth_row: [0,1,0,0,3,0,0,2,0]

- Do not modify any other names in the Sudoku.


# STEP_SEVEN: Shifting the Rows of the Sudoku
- Before you output the Sudoku, the top three rows need to shifted to the bottom, like cutting a deck of cards.
- The rows to be in the order: fourth, fifth, sixth, seventh, eighth, ninth, first, second, third.

- Example:
fourth_row: [9,4,1,6,7,3,2,5,8]
fifth_row: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3]
sixth_row: [7,8,0,0,5,2,6,0,0]
seventh_row: [2,0,4,0,0,0,0,8,0]
eighth_row: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,4]
ninth_row: [0,1,0,0,3,0,0,2,0]
first_row: [0,3,0,5,8,0,4,9,0]
second_row: [0,9,2,0,4,1,0,0,0]
third_row: [0,6,0,7,0,9,0,0,5]


# STEP_EIGHT Fixing the Row Names and Outputting the Sudoku
- WITHOUT moving the elements of the Sudoku, standardize the row names.
- Also surround the Sudoku in output tags to clearly mark it as the output.
- Do not write ANYTHING after the closing output tag, as it will interfere with the system extracting your output.

- Example:
<Output>
first_row: [9,4,1,6,7,3,2,5,8]
second_row: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3]
third_row: [7,8,0,0,5,2,6,0,0]
fourth_row: [2,0,4,0,0,0,0,8,0]
fifth_row: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,4]
sixth_row: [0,1,0,0,3,0,0,2,0]
seventh_row: [0,3,0,5,8,0,4,9,0]
eighth_row: [0,9,2,0,4,1,0,0,0]
ninth_row: [0,6,0,7,0,9,0,0,5]
</Output>


# Final notes
- Ensure all outputs are clearly labeled using the simple headers provided in the instructions.
- Do not use code blocks. Just plain text with the headers in the instructions is fine.
- Stop ONLY after completing STEP_EIGHT, writing NOTHING ELSE after you write the final closing output tag.
- Begin

prompt 3 of 3:
You are going to analyze the sudoku you've just been given.
The analysis will come down to one thing, finding the candidate elements for each unfilled square.
To do this, examine the nine rows, the nine columns, and the nine blocks, and find the elements missing from each set.
Then, for each unfilled square (squares with a '0'), examine the elements missing from the row, column, and 3-by-3 block associated with that square, combine them into a set of common candidates, and check to see whether or not there is Exactly one candidate in that set. Everything else follows from that.



# Board State
Trying to play without vision is difficult, so I want you to follow a very specific format.
I want you to print out the current board state using the _exact_ format shown below (replace the example with the current sudoku).
We are also finding the missing elements of each set. So we are taking the current row, column, or block, and calculating the set-wise difference between that row, column, or block, and the digits 1-9 shown in all_digits.
Each block and its missing elements will (between them) exactly cover the digits from 1 to 9 with no duplicates, and with each number appearing exactly once.
## Rows
all_digits = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]

Print all nine rows and row_missing_elements using the format:
row: [row], row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([row]) = [row_missing_elements]

Examples:
first_row: [1,0,3,4,5,6,0,0,9], first_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([1,0,3,4,5,6,0,0,9]) = [2,7,8]
second_row: [4,5,6,7,8,9,1,2,3], second_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([4,5,6,7,8,9,1,2,3]) = []
third_row: [7,8,0,1,2,3,4,5,6], third_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([7,8,0,1,2,3,4,5,6]) = [9]
fourth_row: [2,3,4,5,6,7,8,0,1], fourth_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([2,3,4,5,6,7,8,0,1]) = [9]
fifth_row: [5,6,7,8,9,1,2,3,4], fifth_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([5,6,7,8,9,1,2,3,4]) = []
sixth_row: [8,9,1,2,0,4,5,6,7], sixth_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([8,9,1,2,0,4,5,6,7]) = [3]
seventh_row: [3,4,5,6,7,8,9,1,2], seventh_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([3,4,5,6,7,8,9,1,2]) = []
eighth_row: [6,0,8,9,1,2,3,0,5], eighth_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([6,0,8,9,1,2,3,0,5]) = [4,7]
ninth_row: [9,0,2,0,4,5,0,7,8], ninth_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([9,0,2,0,4,5,0,7,8]) = [1,3,6]


## Columns
all_digits = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]

Format:
column: [column], column_missing_elements: [all_digits].difference([column]) = [column_missing_elements]

Examples:
first_column: [1,4,7,2,5,8,3,6,9] first_column_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([1,4,7,2,5,8,3,6,9]) = []
second_column: [0,5,8,3,6,9,4,0,0] second_column_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([0,5,8,3,6,9,4,0,0]) = [1,2,7]
third_column: [3,6,0,4,7,1,5,8,2] third_column_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([3,6,0,4,7,1,5,8,2]) = [9]
fourth_column: 

## Blocks
all_digits = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]

Format:
block: (rows: rows in the block; columns: columns in the block):
[block]
block_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([block]) = [block_missing_elements]

Examples:
top_left_block: (rows: first_row, second_row, third_row; columns: first_column, second_column, third_column)
[[1,0,3],
[4,5,6],
[7,8,0]]
top_left_block_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([1,0,3,4,5,6,7,8,0]) = [2,9]

top_middle_block: (rows: first_row, second_row, third_row; columns: fourth_column, fifth_column, sixth_column)
[[4,5,6],
[7,8,9],
[1,2,3]]
top_middle_block_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([4,5,6,7,8,9,1,2,3]) = []

top_right_block: (rows: first_row, second_row, third_row; columns: seventh_column, eighth_column, ninth_column)
[[0,0,9],
[1,2,3],
[4,5,6]]
top_right_block_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([0,0,9,1,2,3,4,5,6]) = [7,8]

middle_left_block: (rows: fourth_row, fifth_row, sixth_row; columns: first_column, second_column, third_column)



# Finding and counting the zero elements
## The positions of the zeroes
For each row we do the following calculations:
row_unfilled_indices: [row].index(0) = [index of every '0' element in the row]
row_unfilled_positions: row_unfilled_indices.increment(1) = [each index incremented by 1]
row_unfilled_columns: the word versions of the positions of the zeroes

Use the following format:
first_row_unfilled_indices: [1,0,3,4,5,6,0,0,9].index(0) = [1,6,7]
first_row_unfilled_positions: first_row_unfilled_indices.increment(1) = [2,7,8]
first_row_unfilled_columns: second, seventh, eighth


## Calculate the number of unfilled squares
A simple one line calculation By Hand to get the total number of unfilled squares:
total_unfilled_squares = 3 + 0 + 1 + 1 + 0 + 1 + 0 + 2 + 3 = 11

Then we cap the number of squares to list:
number_of_squares_to_list = min(total_unfilled_squares, 17) = 11



# Candidate analysis
## Common candidates in each unfilled square
Go through each unfilled square and list the missing elements for the row, column, and block containing that square (use the row and column to get the correct block).
Calculate the elements that are in Both the row, AND the column. Make sure to find ALL of them.
Then calculate the elements that are in Both STEP_A (the previous result), AND the block. Make sure to find ALL of them.

Make sure to ONLY do unfilled squares, which we calculated in the section 'The positions of the zeroes'.
For each unfilled square we examine, we do the following calculations (example below):
STEP_A = row_missing_elements.intersection(column_missing_elements) = [elements in both row_missing_elements AND column_missing_elements]
STEP_B = STEP_A.intersection(block_missing_elements) = [elements in both STEP_A AND block_missing_elements]
common_missing_elements: [STEP_B]
FOUND: square(row, column) (print this line if there is Only one common_missing_element in that square, otherwise leave this line blank and keep going)

Example:
### first_row_unfilled_columns: second, seventh, eighth
#### 1 of {number_of_squares_to_list}
(first_row, second_column):
Using first_row_missing_elements, second_column_missing_elements, and top_left_block_missing_elements (do not list the elements here, just the set names)
STEP_A: [2,7,8].intersection([1,2,7]) = [2,7]
STEP_B: [2,7].intersection([2,9]) = [2]
common_missing_elements: [2]
FOUND: square(first_row, second_column) (If the square has one only one common_missing_element, also print "FOUND ONE: square(row, column)" like this, then keep going)

When we have done as many unfilled squares as specified by number_of_squares_to_list, we stop listing squares and print:
"Finished printing 17 out of 17 squares" (using appropriate numbers)

# Outputting the found squares
## Collating Results
For Every unfilled square that had ONLY one common element (marked with "FOUND: square(row, column)"), we list them below so they are all in one place.

FOUND: square(first_row, second_column)

Make sure to list ALL of them

If there where none, instead print "There were no unfilled squares with only one common_missing_element"


## Unbiased Results
Finally, for every square in the results, we need to list them in the following format:
square(first_row, second_column)
first_row_missing_elements = [2,7,8]
second_column_missing_elements = [1,2,7]
top_left_block_missing_elements = [2,7]

Note that neither of the output sections lists the common_missing_element found in that square. This is to allow unbiased verification of the results.

Make sure to list all of them

If there where none, instead print "There are no candidate squares"

Follow ALL instructions METHODICALLY and IN FULL. Your task is to calculate the possible candidate elements for the given cells, then to update the non-rejected cells of the given sudoku using the calculated candidate elements, then to shift the rows, and finally to output the updated and shifted sudoku. Once you begin you must complete ALL of these tasks BEFORE stopping. After receiving the full instructions you have ONLY one message to finish the task, as soon as you stop responding the final section of your response is sent to the next part of the process. Thus the final text you write MUST be the updated and shifted Sudoku, in the correct format, after ALL other sections have been completed. Begin as soon as you receive the full instruction set.

prompt 7 of 7:
# Task and background
- My previous message contains the last few hundred characters of a Sudoku analysis.
- You are examining the results in the "Unbiased Results" section of the previous message. Ignore all text before that section.
- The cells given in the section "Unbiased Results" are cells which were found to have only one possible candidate.
- However, the process which found the given cells will sometimes make mistakes, due to having to check so many cells at once.
- Your task is to use the given instructions to perform an independent verification or rejection of the given cells.
- Detailed instructions are provided below, but an overview is as follows:
    - Calculate the possible candidate elements for each cell using the method given below.
    - If a cell has multiple candidates, or fails some other given condition, reject that cell as a mistake made by the previous process.
- Complete all steps starting at STEP_ONE.


# STEP_ONE Extracting Previous Results
- Extract the results of the "Unbiased Results" section in the previous message.
- If there is no section marked "Unbiased Results" in the previous message, that means the start of it was cut off. In that case just start with the first complete cell you can see.
- Only take at most the first FOUR cells of the "Unbiased Results" section, as that's all the system can handle.
- Print the text from that section under the current heading "STEP_ONE Extracting Previous Results". Do not print the heading from the previous message.
- Note: When you print the text, change '_missing_elements' to '_candidates' for the row, column, and block for every cell. Everything else should remain the same.
- These cells will be used in STEP_TWO.


# STEP_TWO Calculating the candidates of each cell
- For each cell from STEP_ONE, use the following method to calculate the candidates of that cell.
- For each cell:
    - Loop through the digits 1 to 9
    - For each digit, count the number of times that digit appears in the row_candidates list, the column_candidates list, and the block_candidates lists.
    - On the same line, sum the row count, the column count, and the block count to get the total_count.
    - Most importantly, if the total_count is 3, immediately print "FOUND A THREE".
- At the end of each cell, find all the digits which had a total_count of 3 (marked by FOUND A THREE) and list them as the candidates of that cell.
- Everytime you complete a cell print "Cell {current cell number} of {number of cells} complete! {number of cells left} more to go!"
- Then move to the next cell until all are done.
- If there are more than 4 cells, cap the number to check at 4.

- Here is an example with the correct format:
## Cell 1 of {number of cells}
cell(first_row, second_column):
row = first_row_candidates = [1,2,4,6]
column = second_column_candidates = [2,5,6,7,8,9]
block = top_left_block_candidates = [1,2,3,4,6,7]

row.count(1) = 1, column.count(1) = 0, block.count(1) = 1, total_count(1) = 2
row.count(2) = 1, column.count(2) = 1, block.count(2) = 1, total_count(2) = 3 FOUND A THREE
row.count(3) = 0, column.count(3) = 0, block.count(3) = 1, total_count(3) = 1
row.count(4) = 1, column.count(4) = 0, block.count(4) = 1, total_count(4) = 2
row.count(5) = 0, column.count(5) = 1, block.count(5) = 0, total_count(5) = 1
row.count(6) = 1, column.count(6) = 1, block.count(6) = 1, total_count(6) = 3 FOUND A THREE
row.count(7) = 0, column.count(7) = 1, block.count(7) = 1, total_count(7) = 2
row.count(8) = 0, column.count(8) = 1, block.count(8) = 0, total_count(8) = 1
row.count(9) = 0, column.count(9) = 1, block.count(9) = 0, total_count(9) = 1

Confirmed candidates found for cell(first_row, second_column): [2,6]
Cell 1 of 3 complete! 2 more to go!!!

- After you have done All of the cells, list them in one place.
- Example:
## Candidates of the cells
cell(first_row, second_column): [2,6]
cell(second_row, eighth_column): [9]
cell(fourth_row, second_column): [1]

- Make sure to list All the cells, up to a maximum of 4


# STEP_THREE Checking the number of elements in each cell
- For each cell, count the number of elements in the candidates of that cell using .length().
- After each length, either print "length is 1, Passes" if the length is 1, or print "length is {length}, not 1, Rejected" if the length is Not one.
- Example:
cell(first_row, second_column): [2,6]
[2,6].length = number from 2
length is 2, not 1, Rejected

- After doing this for all the cells, list the cells which Passed, making sure Not to list any Rejected cells.
- Example:
## Passing Cells
cell(second_row, eighth_column): [9]
cell(fourth_row, second_column): [1]


# STEP_FOUR: Grouping Cells with Corresponding Rows
- Group each cell from the "Passing Cells" in STEP_THREE with their corresponding row from the current Sudoku. Do not update them yet.
- If there are no passing cells to update, print "There are no cells to update" and move to the next step.
- The current Sudoku is the second message I sent. Since it's so far back print it here (in the exact format it appears but without the output tags) to avoid confusing it with the examples.

- Example:
Current Sudoku:
{Current Sudoku Goes Here}

first_row: [0,3,0,0,8,0,4,9,0]
cell(first_row, fourth_column): [5]

fourth_row: [0,4,1,6,7,3,2,5,8]
cell(fourth_row, first_column): [9]

seventh_row: [2,0,4,0,0,0,0,8,0]
cell(seventh_row, eighth_column): [3]


# STEP_FIVE: Applying Cell Updates to Rows
- Now that the cells to update are cleanly grouped with the appropriate rows, confirm the column position and update each appropriate row.
- However, and this is VITAL: If the column position does NOT have a zero, IMMEDIATELY reject that cell and move on to the next.

- Example:
first_row: [0,3,0,0,8,0,4,9,0]
cell(first_row, fourth_column): [5]
The 4th position of the first_row is 0, so we can proceed.
Updating the value in the 4th position of the first_row:
updated_first_row: [0,3,0,5,8,0,4,9,0]

fourth_row: [0,4,1,6,7,3,2,5,8]
cell(fourth_row, first_column): [9]
The 1st position of the fourth_row is 0, so we can proceed.
Updating the value in the 1st position of the fourth_row:
updated_fourth_row: [9,4,1,6,7,3,2,5,8]

seventh_row: [2,0,4,0,0,0,0,8,0]
cell(seventh_row, eighth_column): [3]
The 8th position of the seventh_row is 8, WHICH IS NOT 0. This cell is rejected and will not be updated.


# STEP_SIX: Printing the Updated Sudoku
- Now print the Sudoku using the updated rows
- Specify the rows to update first to be sure they aren't forgotten. Do not include any rejected cells.

- Example:
The rows to update are first and fourth
updated_first_row: [0,3,0,5,8,0,4,9,0]
second_row: [0,9,2,0,4,1,0,0,0]
third_row: [0,6,0,7,0,9,0,0,5]
updated_fourth_row: [9,4,1,6,7,3,2,5,8]
fifth_row: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3]
sixth_row: [7,8,0,0,5,2,6,0,0]
seventh_row: [2,0,4,0,0,0,0,8,0]
eighth_row: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,4]
ninth_row: [0,1,0,0,3,0,0,2,0]


# Standardizing Row Names in the Updated Sudoku
- Print the Sudoku you just updated, but with the the original NAMES for the rows.
- Make sure the elements are from the UPDATED Sudoku in STEP_SIX.
- As there is now an old and an updated Sudoku, both of which look similar, write the following above the updated Sudoku
"The rows to fix the NAMES of are {rows to change}. The elements are the same as in STEP_SIX."

- Example:
The rows to fix the NAMES of are first and fourth. The elements are the same as in STEP_SIX.

first_row: [0,3,0,5,8,0,4,9,0]
second_row: [0,9,2,0,4,1,0,0,0]
third_row: [0,6,0,7,0,9,0,0,5]
fourth_row: [9,4,1,6,7,3,2,5,8]
fifth_row: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3]
sixth_row: [7,8,0,0,5,2,6,0,0]
seventh_row: [2,0,4,0,0,0,0,8,0]
eighth_row: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,4]
ninth_row: [0,1,0,0,3,0,0,2,0]

- Do not modify any other names in the Sudoku.


# STEP_SEVEN: Shifting the Rows of the Sudoku
- Before you output the Sudoku, the top three rows need to shifted to the bottom, like cutting a deck of cards.
- The rows to be in the order: fourth, fifth, sixth, seventh, eighth, ninth, first, second, third.

- Example:
fourth_row: [9,4,1,6,7,3,2,5,8]
fifth_row: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3]
sixth_row: [7,8,0,0,5,2,6,0,0]
seventh_row: [2,0,4,0,0,0,0,8,0]
eighth_row: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,4]
ninth_row: [0,1,0,0,3,0,0,2,0]
first_row: [0,3,0,5,8,0,4,9,0]
second_row: [0,9,2,0,4,1,0,0,0]
third_row: [0,6,0,7,0,9,0,0,5]


# STEP_EIGHT Fixing the Row Names and Outputting the Sudoku
- WITHOUT moving the elements of the Sudoku, standardize the row names.
- Also surround the Sudoku in output tags to clearly mark it as the output.
- Do not write ANYTHING after the closing output tag, as it will interfere with the system extracting your output.

- Example:
<Output>
first_row: [9,4,1,6,7,3,2,5,8]
second_row: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3]
third_row: [7,8,0,0,5,2,6,0,0]
fourth_row: [2,0,4,0,0,0,0,8,0]
fifth_row: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,4]
sixth_row: [0,1,0,0,3,0,0,2,0]
seventh_row: [0,3,0,5,8,0,4,9,0]
eighth_row: [0,9,2,0,4,1,0,0,0]
ninth_row: [0,6,0,7,0,9,0,0,5]
</Output>


# Final notes
- Ensure all outputs are clearly labeled using the simple headers provided in the instructions.
- Do not use code blocks. Just plain text with the headers in the instructions is fine.
- Stop ONLY after completing STEP_EIGHT, writing NOTHING ELSE after you write the final closing output tag.
- Begin

prompt 3 of 3:
You are going to analyze the sudoku you've just been given.
The analysis will come down to one thing, finding the candidate elements for each unfilled square.
To do this, examine the nine rows, the nine columns, and the nine blocks, and find the elements missing from each set.
Then, for each unfilled square (squares with a '0'), examine the elements missing from the row, column, and 3-by-3 block associated with that square, combine them into a set of common candidates, and check to see whether or not there is Exactly one candidate in that set. Everything else follows from that.



# Board State
Trying to play without vision is difficult, so I want you to follow a very specific format.
I want you to print out the current board state using the _exact_ format shown below (replace the example with the current sudoku).
We are also finding the missing elements of each set. So we are taking the current row, column, or block, and calculating the set-wise difference between that row, column, or block, and the digits 1-9 shown in all_digits.
Each block and its missing elements will (between them) exactly cover the digits from 1 to 9 with no duplicates, and with each number appearing exactly once.
## Rows
all_digits = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]

Print all nine rows and row_missing_elements using the format:
row: [row], row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([row]) = [row_missing_elements]

Examples:
first_row: [1,0,3,4,5,6,0,0,9], first_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([1,0,3,4,5,6,0,0,9]) = [2,7,8]
second_row: [4,5,6,7,8,9,1,2,3], second_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([4,5,6,7,8,9,1,2,3]) = []
third_row: [7,8,0,1,2,3,4,5,6], third_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([7,8,0,1,2,3,4,5,6]) = [9]
fourth_row: [2,3,4,5,6,7,8,0,1], fourth_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([2,3,4,5,6,7,8,0,1]) = [9]
fifth_row: [5,6,7,8,9,1,2,3,4], fifth_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([5,6,7,8,9,1,2,3,4]) = []
sixth_row: [8,9,1,2,0,4,5,6,7], sixth_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([8,9,1,2,0,4,5,6,7]) = [3]
seventh_row: [3,4,5,6,7,8,9,1,2], seventh_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([3,4,5,6,7,8,9,1,2]) = []
eighth_row: [6,0,8,9,1,2,3,0,5], eighth_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([6,0,8,9,1,2,3,0,5]) = [4,7]
ninth_row: [9,0,2,0,4,5,0,7,8], ninth_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([9,0,2,0,4,5,0,7,8]) = [1,3,6]


## Columns
all_digits = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]

Format:
column: [column], column_missing_elements: [all_digits].difference([column]) = [column_missing_elements]

Examples:
first_column: [1,4,7,2,5,8,3,6,9] first_column_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([1,4,7,2,5,8,3,6,9]) = []
second_column: [0,5,8,3,6,9,4,0,0] second_column_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([0,5,8,3,6,9,4,0,0]) = [1,2,7]
third_column: [3,6,0,4,7,1,5,8,2] third_column_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([3,6,0,4,7,1,5,8,2]) = [9]
fourth_column: 

## Blocks
all_digits = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]

Format:
block: (rows: rows in the block; columns: columns in the block):
[block]
block_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([block]) = [block_missing_elements]

Examples:
top_left_block: (rows: first_row, second_row, third_row; columns: first_column, second_column, third_column)
[[1,0,3],
[4,5,6],
[7,8,0]]
top_left_block_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([1,0,3,4,5,6,7,8,0]) = [2,9]

top_middle_block: (rows: first_row, second_row, third_row; columns: fourth_column, fifth_column, sixth_column)
[[4,5,6],
[7,8,9],
[1,2,3]]
top_middle_block_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([4,5,6,7,8,9,1,2,3]) = []

top_right_block: (rows: first_row, second_row, third_row; columns: seventh_column, eighth_column, ninth_column)
[[0,0,9],
[1,2,3],
[4,5,6]]
top_right_block_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([0,0,9,1,2,3,4,5,6]) = [7,8]

middle_left_block: (rows: fourth_row, fifth_row, sixth_row; columns: first_column, second_column, third_column)



# Finding and counting the zero elements
## The positions of the zeroes
For each row we do the following calculations:
row_unfilled_indices: [row].index(0) = [index of every '0' element in the row]
row_unfilled_positions: row_unfilled_indices.increment(1) = [each index incremented by 1]
row_unfilled_columns: the word versions of the positions of the zeroes

Use the following format:
first_row_unfilled_indices: [1,0,3,4,5,6,0,0,9].index(0) = [1,6,7]
first_row_unfilled_positions: first_row_unfilled_indices.increment(1) = [2,7,8]
first_row_unfilled_columns: second, seventh, eighth


## Calculate the number of unfilled squares
A simple one line calculation By Hand to get the total number of unfilled squares:
total_unfilled_squares = 3 + 0 + 1 + 1 + 0 + 1 + 0 + 2 + 3 = 11

Then we cap the number of squares to list:
number_of_squares_to_list = min(total_unfilled_squares, 17) = 11



# Candidate analysis
## Common candidates in each unfilled square
Go through each unfilled square and list the missing elements for the row, column, and block containing that square (use the row and column to get the correct block).
Calculate the elements that are in Both the row, AND the column. Make sure to find ALL of them.
Then calculate the elements that are in Both STEP_A (the previous result), AND the block. Make sure to find ALL of them.

Make sure to ONLY do unfilled squares, which we calculated in the section 'The positions of the zeroes'.
For each unfilled square we examine, we do the following calculations (example below):
STEP_A = row_missing_elements.intersection(column_missing_elements) = [elements in both row_missing_elements AND column_missing_elements]
STEP_B = STEP_A.intersection(block_missing_elements) = [elements in both STEP_A AND block_missing_elements]
common_missing_elements: [STEP_B]
FOUND: square(row, column) (print this line if there is Only one common_missing_element in that square, otherwise leave this line blank and keep going)

Example:
### first_row_unfilled_columns: second, seventh, eighth
#### 1 of {number_of_squares_to_list}
(first_row, second_column):
Using first_row_missing_elements, second_column_missing_elements, and top_left_block_missing_elements (do not list the elements here, just the set names)
STEP_A: [2,7,8].intersection([1,2,7]) = [2,7]
STEP_B: [2,7].intersection([2,9]) = [2]
common_missing_elements: [2]
FOUND: square(first_row, second_column) (If the square has one only one common_missing_element, also print "FOUND ONE: square(row, column)" like this, then keep going)

When we have done as many unfilled squares as specified by number_of_squares_to_list, we stop listing squares and print:
"Finished printing 17 out of 17 squares" (using appropriate numbers)

# Outputting the found squares
## Collating Results
For Every unfilled square that had ONLY one common element (marked with "FOUND: square(row, column)"), we list them below so they are all in one place.

FOUND: square(first_row, second_column)

Make sure to list ALL of them

If there where none, instead print "There were no unfilled squares with only one common_missing_element"


## Unbiased Results
Finally, for every square in the results, we need to list them in the following format:
square(first_row, second_column)
first_row_missing_elements = [2,7,8]
second_column_missing_elements = [1,2,7]
top_left_block_missing_elements = [2,7]

Note that neither of the output sections lists the common_missing_element found in that square. This is to allow unbiased verification of the results.

Make sure to list all of them

If there where none, instead print "There are no candidate squares"

prompt 7 of 7:
# Task and background
- My previous message contains the last few hundred characters of a Sudoku analysis.
- You are examining the results in the "Unbiased Results" section of the previous message. Ignore all text before that section.
- The cells given in the section "Unbiased Results" are cells which were found to have only one possible candidate.
- However, the process which found the given cells will sometimes make mistakes, due to having to check so many cells at once.
- Your task is to use the given instructions to perform an independent verification or rejection of the given cells.
- Detailed instructions are provided below, but an overview is as follows:
    - Calculate the possible candidate elements for each cell using the method given below.
    - If a cell has multiple candidates, or fails some other given condition, reject that cell as a mistake made by the previous process.
- Complete all steps starting at STEP_ONE.


# STEP_ONE Extracting Previous Results
- Extract the results of the "Unbiased Results" section in the previous message.
- If there is no section marked "Unbiased Results" in the previous message, that means the start of it was cut off. In that case just start with the first complete cell you can see.
- Only take at most the first FOUR cells of the "Unbiased Results" section, as that's all the system can handle.
- Print the text from that section under the current heading "STEP_ONE Extracting Previous Results". Do not print the heading from the previous message.
- Note: When you print the text, change '_missing_elements' to '_candidates' for the row, column, and block for every cell. Everything else should remain the same.
- These cells will be used in STEP_TWO.


# STEP_TWO Calculating the candidates of each cell
- For each cell from STEP_ONE, use the following method to calculate the candidates of that cell.
- For each cell:
    - Loop through the digits 1 to 9
    - For each digit, count the number of times that digit appears in the row_candidates list, the column_candidates list, and the block_candidates lists.
    - On the same line, sum the row count, the column count, and the block count to get the total_count.
    - Most importantly, if the total_count is 3, immediately print "FOUND A THREE".
- At the end of each cell, find all the digits which had a total_count of 3 (marked by FOUND A THREE) and list them as the candidates of that cell.
- Everytime you complete a cell print "Cell {current cell number} of {number of cells} complete! {number of cells left} more to go!"
- Then move to the next cell until all are done.
- If there are more than 4 cells, cap the number to check at 4.

- Here is an example with the correct format:
## Cell 1 of {number of cells}
cell(first_row, second_column):
row = first_row_candidates = [1,2,4,6]
column = second_column_candidates = [2,5,6,7,8,9]
block = top_left_block_candidates = [1,2,3,4,6,7]

row.count(1) = 1, column.count(1) = 0, block.count(1) = 1, total_count(1) = 2
row.count(2) = 1, column.count(2) = 1, block.count(2) = 1, total_count(2) = 3 FOUND A THREE
row.count(3) = 0, column.count(3) = 0, block.count(3) = 1, total_count(3) = 1
row.count(4) = 1, column.count(4) = 0, block.count(4) = 1, total_count(4) = 2
row.count(5) = 0, column.count(5) = 1, block.count(5) = 0, total_count(5) = 1
row.count(6) = 1, column.count(6) = 1, block.count(6) = 1, total_count(6) = 3 FOUND A THREE
row.count(7) = 0, column.count(7) = 1, block.count(7) = 1, total_count(7) = 2
row.count(8) = 0, column.count(8) = 1, block.count(8) = 0, total_count(8) = 1
row.count(9) = 0, column.count(9) = 1, block.count(9) = 0, total_count(9) = 1

Confirmed candidates found for cell(first_row, second_column): [2,6]
Cell 1 of 3 complete! 2 more to go!!!

- After you have done All of the cells, list them in one place.
- Example:
## Candidates of the cells
cell(first_row, second_column): [2,6]
cell(second_row, eighth_column): [9]
cell(fourth_row, second_column): [1]

- Make sure to list All the cells, up to a maximum of 4


# STEP_THREE Checking the number of elements in each cell
- For each cell, count the number of elements in the candidates of that cell using .length().
- After each length, either print "length is 1, Passes" if the length is 1, or print "length is {length}, not 1, Rejected" if the length is Not one.
- Example:
cell(first_row, second_column): [2,6]
[2,6].length = number from 2
length is 2, not 1, Rejected

- After doing this for all the cells, list the cells which Passed, making sure Not to list any Rejected cells.
- Example:
## Passing Cells
cell(second_row, eighth_column): [9]
cell(fourth_row, second_column): [1]


# STEP_FOUR: Grouping Cells with Corresponding Rows
- Group each cell from the "Passing Cells" in STEP_THREE with their corresponding row from the current Sudoku. Do not update them yet.
- If there are no passing cells to update, print "There are no cells to update" and move to the next step.
- The current Sudoku is the second message I sent. Since it's so far back print it here (in the exact format it appears but without the output tags) to avoid confusing it with the examples.

- Example:
Current Sudoku:
{Current Sudoku Goes Here}

first_row: [0,3,0,0,8,0,4,9,0]
cell(first_row, fourth_column): [5]

fourth_row: [0,4,1,6,7,3,2,5,8]
cell(fourth_row, first_column): [9]

seventh_row: [2,0,4,0,0,0,0,8,0]
cell(seventh_row, eighth_column): [3]


# STEP_FIVE: Applying Cell Updates to Rows
- Now that the cells to update are cleanly grouped with the appropriate rows, confirm the column position and update each appropriate row.
- However, and this is VITAL: If the column position does NOT have a zero, IMMEDIATELY reject that cell and move on to the next.

- Example:
first_row: [0,3,0,0,8,0,4,9,0]
cell(first_row, fourth_column): [5]
The 4th position of the first_row is 0, so we can proceed.
Updating the value in the 4th position of the first_row:
updated_first_row: [0,3,0,5,8,0,4,9,0]

fourth_row: [0,4,1,6,7,3,2,5,8]
cell(fourth_row, first_column): [9]
The 1st position of the fourth_row is 0, so we can proceed.
Updating the value in the 1st position of the fourth_row:
updated_fourth_row: [9,4,1,6,7,3,2,5,8]

seventh_row: [2,0,4,0,0,0,0,8,0]
cell(seventh_row, eighth_column): [3]
The 8th position of the seventh_row is 8, WHICH IS NOT 0. This cell is rejected and will not be updated.


# STEP_SIX: Printing the Updated Sudoku
- Now print the Sudoku using the updated rows
- Specify the rows to update first to be sure they aren't forgotten. Do not include any rejected cells.

- Example:
The rows to update are first and fourth
updated_first_row: [0,3,0,5,8,0,4,9,0]
second_row: [0,9,2,0,4,1,0,0,0]
third_row: [0,6,0,7,0,9,0,0,5]
updated_fourth_row: [9,4,1,6,7,3,2,5,8]
fifth_row: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3]
sixth_row: [7,8,0,0,5,2,6,0,0]
seventh_row: [2,0,4,0,0,0,0,8,0]
eighth_row: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,4]
ninth_row: [0,1,0,0,3,0,0,2,0]


# Standardizing Row Names in the Updated Sudoku
- Print the Sudoku you just updated, but with the the original NAMES for the rows.
- Make sure the elements are from the UPDATED Sudoku in STEP_SIX.
- As there is now an old and an updated Sudoku, both of which look similar, write the following above the updated Sudoku
"The rows to fix the NAMES of are {rows to change}. The elements are the same as in STEP_SIX."

- Example:
The rows to fix the NAMES of are first and fourth. The elements are the same as in STEP_SIX.

first_row: [0,3,0,5,8,0,4,9,0]
second_row: [0,9,2,0,4,1,0,0,0]
third_row: [0,6,0,7,0,9,0,0,5]
fourth_row: [9,4,1,6,7,3,2,5,8]
fifth_row: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3]
sixth_row: [7,8,0,0,5,2,6,0,0]
seventh_row: [2,0,4,0,0,0,0,8,0]
eighth_row: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,4]
ninth_row: [0,1,0,0,3,0,0,2,0]

- Do not modify any other names in the Sudoku.


# STEP_SEVEN: Shifting the Rows of the Sudoku
- Before you output the Sudoku, the top three rows need to shifted to the bottom, like cutting a deck of cards.
- The rows to be in the order: fourth, fifth, sixth, seventh, eighth, ninth, first, second, third.

- Example:
fourth_row: [9,4,1,6,7,3,2,5,8]
fifth_row: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3]
sixth_row: [7,8,0,0,5,2,6,0,0]
seventh_row: [2,0,4,0,0,0,0,8,0]
eighth_row: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,4]
ninth_row: [0,1,0,0,3,0,0,2,0]
first_row: [0,3,0,5,8,0,4,9,0]
second_row: [0,9,2,0,4,1,0,0,0]
third_row: [0,6,0,7,0,9,0,0,5]


# STEP_EIGHT Fixing the Row Names and Outputting the Sudoku
- WITHOUT moving the elements of the Sudoku, standardize the row names.
- Also surround the Sudoku in output tags to clearly mark it as the output.
- Do not write ANYTHING after the closing output tag, as it will interfere with the system extracting your output.

- Example:
<Output>
first_row: [9,4,1,6,7,3,2,5,8]
second_row: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3]
third_row: [7,8,0,0,5,2,6,0,0]
fourth_row: [2,0,4,0,0,0,0,8,0]
fifth_row: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,4]
sixth_row: [0,1,0,0,3,0,0,2,0]
seventh_row: [0,3,0,5,8,0,4,9,0]
eighth_row: [0,9,2,0,4,1,0,0,0]
ninth_row: [0,6,0,7,0,9,0,0,5]
</Output>


# Final notes
- Ensure all outputs are clearly labeled using the simple headers provided in the instructions.
- Do not use code blocks. Just plain text with the headers in the instructions is fine.
- Stop ONLY after completing STEP_EIGHT, writing NOTHING ELSE after you write the final closing output tag.
- Begin

prompt 3 of 3:
You are going to analyze the sudoku you've just been given.
The analysis will come down to one thing, finding the candidate elements for each unfilled square.
To do this, examine the nine rows, the nine columns, and the nine blocks, and find the elements missing from each set.
Then, for each unfilled square (squares with a '0'), examine the elements missing from the row, column, and 3-by-3 block associated with that square, combine them into a set of common candidates, and check to see whether or not there is Exactly one candidate in that set. Everything else follows from that.



# Board State
Trying to play without vision is difficult, so I want you to follow a very specific format.
I want you to print out the current board state using the _exact_ format shown below (replace the example with the current sudoku).
We are also finding the missing elements of each set. So we are taking the current row, column, or block, and calculating the set-wise difference between that row, column, or block, and the digits 1-9 shown in all_digits.
Each block and its missing elements will (between them) exactly cover the digits from 1 to 9 with no duplicates, and with each number appearing exactly once.
## Rows
all_digits = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]

Print all nine rows and row_missing_elements using the format:
row: [row], row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([row]) = [row_missing_elements]

Examples:
first_row: [1,0,3,4,5,6,0,0,9], first_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([1,0,3,4,5,6,0,0,9]) = [2,7,8]
second_row: [4,5,6,7,8,9,1,2,3], second_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([4,5,6,7,8,9,1,2,3]) = []
third_row: [7,8,0,1,2,3,4,5,6], third_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([7,8,0,1,2,3,4,5,6]) = [9]
fourth_row: [2,3,4,5,6,7,8,0,1], fourth_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([2,3,4,5,6,7,8,0,1]) = [9]
fifth_row: [5,6,7,8,9,1,2,3,4], fifth_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([5,6,7,8,9,1,2,3,4]) = []
sixth_row: [8,9,1,2,0,4,5,6,7], sixth_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([8,9,1,2,0,4,5,6,7]) = [3]
seventh_row: [3,4,5,6,7,8,9,1,2], seventh_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([3,4,5,6,7,8,9,1,2]) = []
eighth_row: [6,0,8,9,1,2,3,0,5], eighth_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([6,0,8,9,1,2,3,0,5]) = [4,7]
ninth_row: [9,0,2,0,4,5,0,7,8], ninth_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([9,0,2,0,4,5,0,7,8]) = [1,3,6]


## Columns
all_digits = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]

Format:
column: [column], column_missing_elements: [all_digits].difference([column]) = [column_missing_elements]

Examples:
first_column: [1,4,7,2,5,8,3,6,9] first_column_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([1,4,7,2,5,8,3,6,9]) = []
second_column: [0,5,8,3,6,9,4,0,0] second_column_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([0,5,8,3,6,9,4,0,0]) = [1,2,7]
third_column: [3,6,0,4,7,1,5,8,2] third_column_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([3,6,0,4,7,1,5,8,2]) = [9]
fourth_column: 

## Blocks
all_digits = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]

Format:
block: (rows: rows in the block; columns: columns in the block):
[block]
block_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([block]) = [block_missing_elements]

Examples:
top_left_block: (rows: first_row, second_row, third_row; columns: first_column, second_column, third_column)
[[1,0,3],
[4,5,6],
[7,8,0]]
top_left_block_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([1,0,3,4,5,6,7,8,0]) = [2,9]

top_middle_block: (rows: first_row, second_row, third_row; columns: fourth_column, fifth_column, sixth_column)
[[4,5,6],
[7,8,9],
[1,2,3]]
top_middle_block_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([4,5,6,7,8,9,1,2,3]) = []

top_right_block: (rows: first_row, second_row, third_row; columns: seventh_column, eighth_column, ninth_column)
[[0,0,9],
[1,2,3],
[4,5,6]]
top_right_block_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([0,0,9,1,2,3,4,5,6]) = [7,8]

middle_left_block: (rows: fourth_row, fifth_row, sixth_row; columns: first_column, second_column, third_column)



# Finding and counting the zero elements
## The positions of the zeroes
For each row we do the following calculations:
row_unfilled_indices: [row].index(0) = [index of every '0' element in the row]
row_unfilled_positions: row_unfilled_indices.increment(1) = [each index incremented by 1]
row_unfilled_columns: the word versions of the positions of the zeroes

Use the following format:
first_row_unfilled_indices: [1,0,3,4,5,6,0,0,9].index(0) = [1,6,7]
first_row_unfilled_positions: first_row_unfilled_indices.increment(1) = [2,7,8]
first_row_unfilled_columns: second, seventh, eighth


## Calculate the number of unfilled squares
A simple one line calculation By Hand to get the total number of unfilled squares:
total_unfilled_squares = 3 + 0 + 1 + 1 + 0 + 1 + 0 + 2 + 3 = 11

Then we cap the number of squares to list:
number_of_squares_to_list = min(total_unfilled_squares, 17) = 11



# Candidate analysis
## Common candidates in each unfilled square
Go through each unfilled square and list the missing elements for the row, column, and block containing that square (use the row and column to get the correct block).
Calculate the elements that are in Both the row, AND the column. Make sure to find ALL of them.
Then calculate the elements that are in Both STEP_A (the previous result), AND the block. Make sure to find ALL of them.

Make sure to ONLY do unfilled squares, which we calculated in the section 'The positions of the zeroes'.
For each unfilled square we examine, we do the following calculations (example below):
STEP_A = row_missing_elements.intersection(column_missing_elements) = [elements in both row_missing_elements AND column_missing_elements]
STEP_B = STEP_A.intersection(block_missing_elements) = [elements in both STEP_A AND block_missing_elements]
common_missing_elements: [STEP_B]
FOUND: square(row, column) (print this line if there is Only one common_missing_element in that square, otherwise leave this line blank and keep going)

Example:
### first_row_unfilled_columns: second, seventh, eighth
#### 1 of {number_of_squares_to_list}
(first_row, second_column):
Using first_row_missing_elements, second_column_missing_elements, and top_left_block_missing_elements (do not list the elements here, just the set names)
STEP_A: [2,7,8].intersection([1,2,7]) = [2,7]
STEP_B: [2,7].intersection([2,9]) = [2]
common_missing_elements: [2]
FOUND: square(first_row, second_column) (If the square has one only one common_missing_element, also print "FOUND ONE: square(row, column)" like this, then keep going)

When we have done as many unfilled squares as specified by number_of_squares_to_list, we stop listing squares and print:
"Finished printing 17 out of 17 squares" (using appropriate numbers)

# Outputting the found squares
## Collating Results
For Every unfilled square that had ONLY one common element (marked with "FOUND: square(row, column)"), we list them below so they are all in one place.

FOUND: square(first_row, second_column)

Make sure to list ALL of them

If there where none, instead print "There were no unfilled squares with only one common_missing_element"


## Unbiased Results
Finally, for every square in the results, we need to list them in the following format:
square(first_row, second_column)
first_row_missing_elements = [2,7,8]
second_column_missing_elements = [1,2,7]
top_left_block_missing_elements = [2,7]

Note that neither of the output sections lists the common_missing_element found in that square. This is to allow unbiased verification of the results.

Make sure to list all of them

If there where none, instead print "There are no candidate squares"

prompt 7 of 7:
# Task and background
- My previous message contains the last few hundred characters of a Sudoku analysis.
- You are examining the results in the "Unbiased Results" section of the previous message. Ignore all text before that section.
- The cells given in the section "Unbiased Results" are cells which were found to have only one possible candidate.
- However, the process which found the given cells will sometimes make mistakes, due to having to check so many cells at once.
- Your task is to use the given instructions to perform an independent verification or rejection of the given cells.
- Detailed instructions are provided below, but an overview is as follows:
    - Calculate the possible candidate elements for each cell using the method given below.
    - If a cell has multiple candidates, or fails some other given condition, reject that cell as a mistake made by the previous process.
- Complete all steps starting at STEP_ONE.


# STEP_ONE Extracting Previous Results
- Extract the results of the "Unbiased Results" section in the previous message.
- If there is no section marked "Unbiased Results" in the previous message, that means the start of it was cut off. In that case just start with the first complete cell you can see.
- Only take at most the first FOUR cells of the "Unbiased Results" section, as that's all the system can handle.
- Print the text from that section under the current heading "STEP_ONE Extracting Previous Results". Do not print the heading from the previous message.
- Note: When you print the text, change '_missing_elements' to '_candidates' for the row, column, and block for every cell. Everything else should remain the same.
- These cells will be used in STEP_TWO.


# STEP_TWO Calculating the candidates of each cell
- For each cell from STEP_ONE, use the following method to calculate the candidates of that cell.
- For each cell:
    - Loop through the digits 1 to 9
    - For each digit, count the number of times that digit appears in the row_candidates list, the column_candidates list, and the block_candidates lists.
    - On the same line, sum the row count, the column count, and the block count to get the total_count.
    - Most importantly, if the total_count is 3, immediately print "FOUND A THREE".
- At the end of each cell, find all the digits which had a total_count of 3 (marked by FOUND A THREE) and list them as the candidates of that cell.
- Everytime you complete a cell print "Cell {current cell number} of {number of cells} complete! {number of cells left} more to go!"
- Then move to the next cell until all are done.
- If there are more than 4 cells, cap the number to check at 4.

- Here is an example with the correct format:
## Cell 1 of {number of cells}
cell(first_row, second_column):
row = first_row_candidates = [1,2,4,6]
column = second_column_candidates = [2,5,6,7,8,9]
block = top_left_block_candidates = [1,2,3,4,6,7]

row.count(1) = 1, column.count(1) = 0, block.count(1) = 1, total_count(1) = 2
row.count(2) = 1, column.count(2) = 1, block.count(2) = 1, total_count(2) = 3 FOUND A THREE
row.count(3) = 0, column.count(3) = 0, block.count(3) = 1, total_count(3) = 1
row.count(4) = 1, column.count(4) = 0, block.count(4) = 1, total_count(4) = 2
row.count(5) = 0, column.count(5) = 1, block.count(5) = 0, total_count(5) = 1
row.count(6) = 1, column.count(6) = 1, block.count(6) = 1, total_count(6) = 3 FOUND A THREE
row.count(7) = 0, column.count(7) = 1, block.count(7) = 1, total_count(7) = 2
row.count(8) = 0, column.count(8) = 1, block.count(8) = 0, total_count(8) = 1
row.count(9) = 0, column.count(9) = 1, block.count(9) = 0, total_count(9) = 1

Confirmed candidates found for cell(first_row, second_column): [2,6]
Cell 1 of 3 complete! 2 more to go!!!

- After you have done All of the cells, list them in one place.
- Example:
## Candidates of the cells
cell(first_row, second_column): [2,6]
cell(second_row, eighth_column): [9]
cell(fourth_row, second_column): [1]

- Make sure to list All the cells, up to a maximum of 4


# STEP_THREE Checking the number of elements in each cell
- For each cell, count the number of elements in the candidates of that cell using .length().
- After each length, either print "length is 1, Passes" if the length is 1, or print "length is {length}, not 1, Rejected" if the length is Not one.
- Example:
cell(first_row, second_column): [2,6]
[2,6].length = number from 2
length is 2, not 1, Rejected

- After doing this for all the cells, list the cells which Passed, making sure Not to list any Rejected cells.
- Example:
## Passing Cells
cell(second_row, eighth_column): [9]
cell(fourth_row, second_column): [1]


# STEP_FOUR: Grouping Cells with Corresponding Rows
- Group each cell from the "Passing Cells" in STEP_THREE with their corresponding row from the current Sudoku. Do not update them yet.
- If there are no passing cells to update, print "There are no cells to update" and move to the next step.
- The current Sudoku is the second message I sent. Since it's so far back print it here (in the exact format it appears but without the output tags) to avoid confusing it with the examples.

- Example:
Current Sudoku:
{Current Sudoku Goes Here}

first_row: [0,3,0,0,8,0,4,9,0]
cell(first_row, fourth_column): [5]

fourth_row: [0,4,1,6,7,3,2,5,8]
cell(fourth_row, first_column): [9]

seventh_row: [2,0,4,0,0,0,0,8,0]
cell(seventh_row, eighth_column): [3]


# STEP_FIVE: Applying Cell Updates to Rows
- Now that the cells to update are cleanly grouped with the appropriate rows, confirm the column position and update each appropriate row.
- However, and this is VITAL: If the column position does NOT have a zero, IMMEDIATELY reject that cell and move on to the next.

- Example:
first_row: [0,3,0,0,8,0,4,9,0]
cell(first_row, fourth_column): [5]
The 4th position of the first_row is 0, so we can proceed.
Updating the value in the 4th position of the first_row:
updated_first_row: [0,3,0,5,8,0,4,9,0]

fourth_row: [0,4,1,6,7,3,2,5,8]
cell(fourth_row, first_column): [9]
The 1st position of the fourth_row is 0, so we can proceed.
Updating the value in the 1st position of the fourth_row:
updated_fourth_row: [9,4,1,6,7,3,2,5,8]

seventh_row: [2,0,4,0,0,0,0,8,0]
cell(seventh_row, eighth_column): [3]
The 8th position of the seventh_row is 8, WHICH IS NOT 0. This cell is rejected and will not be updated.


# STEP_SIX: Printing the Updated Sudoku
- Now print the Sudoku using the updated rows
- Specify the rows to update first to be sure they aren't forgotten. Do not include any rejected cells.

- Example:
The rows to update are first and fourth
updated_first_row: [0,3,0,5,8,0,4,9,0]
second_row: [0,9,2,0,4,1,0,0,0]
third_row: [0,6,0,7,0,9,0,0,5]
updated_fourth_row: [9,4,1,6,7,3,2,5,8]
fifth_row: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3]
sixth_row: [7,8,0,0,5,2,6,0,0]
seventh_row: [2,0,4,0,0,0,0,8,0]
eighth_row: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,4]
ninth_row: [0,1,0,0,3,0,0,2,0]


# Standardizing Row Names in the Updated Sudoku
- Print the Sudoku you just updated, but with the the original NAMES for the rows.
- Make sure the elements are from the UPDATED Sudoku in STEP_SIX.
- As there is now an old and an updated Sudoku, both of which look similar, write the following above the updated Sudoku
"The rows to fix the NAMES of are {rows to change}. The elements are the same as in STEP_SIX."

- Example:
The rows to fix the NAMES of are first and fourth. The elements are the same as in STEP_SIX.

first_row: [0,3,0,5,8,0,4,9,0]
second_row: [0,9,2,0,4,1,0,0,0]
third_row: [0,6,0,7,0,9,0,0,5]
fourth_row: [9,4,1,6,7,3,2,5,8]
fifth_row: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3]
sixth_row: [7,8,0,0,5,2,6,0,0]
seventh_row: [2,0,4,0,0,0,0,8,0]
eighth_row: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,4]
ninth_row: [0,1,0,0,3,0,0,2,0]

- Do not modify any other names in the Sudoku.


# STEP_SEVEN: Shifting the Rows of the Sudoku
- Before you output the Sudoku, the top three rows need to shifted to the bottom, like cutting a deck of cards.
- The rows to be in the order: fourth, fifth, sixth, seventh, eighth, ninth, first, second, third.

- Example:
fourth_row: [9,4,1,6,7,3,2,5,8]
fifth_row: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3]
sixth_row: [7,8,0,0,5,2,6,0,0]
seventh_row: [2,0,4,0,0,0,0,8,0]
eighth_row: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,4]
ninth_row: [0,1,0,0,3,0,0,2,0]
first_row: [0,3,0,5,8,0,4,9,0]
second_row: [0,9,2,0,4,1,0,0,0]
third_row: [0,6,0,7,0,9,0,0,5]


# STEP_EIGHT Fixing the Row Names and Outputting the Sudoku
- WITHOUT moving the elements of the Sudoku, standardize the row names.
- Also surround the Sudoku in output tags to clearly mark it as the output.
- Do not write ANYTHING after the closing output tag, as it will interfere with the system extracting your output.

- Example:
<Output>
first_row: [9,4,1,6,7,3,2,5,8]
second_row: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3]
third_row: [7,8,0,0,5,2,6,0,0]
fourth_row: [2,0,4,0,0,0,0,8,0]
fifth_row: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,4]
sixth_row: [0,1,0,0,3,0,0,2,0]
seventh_row: [0,3,0,5,8,0,4,9,0]
eighth_row: [0,9,2,0,4,1,0,0,0]
ninth_row: [0,6,0,7,0,9,0,0,5]
</Output>


# Final notes
- Ensure all outputs are clearly labeled using the simple headers provided in the instructions.
- Do not use code blocks. Just plain text with the headers in the instructions is fine.
- Stop ONLY after completing STEP_EIGHT, writing NOTHING ELSE after you write the final closing output tag.
- Begin

prompt 3 of 3:
You are going to analyze the sudoku you've just been given.
The analysis will come down to one thing, finding the candidate elements for each unfilled square.
To do this, examine the nine rows, the nine columns, and the nine blocks, and find the elements missing from each set.
Then, for each unfilled square (squares with a '0'), examine the elements missing from the row, column, and 3-by-3 block associated with that square, combine them into a set of common candidates, and check to see whether or not there is Exactly one candidate in that set. Everything else follows from that.



# Board State
Trying to play without vision is difficult, so I want you to follow a very specific format.
I want you to print out the current board state using the _exact_ format shown below (replace the example with the current sudoku).
We are also finding the missing elements of each set. So we are taking the current row, column, or block, and calculating the set-wise difference between that row, column, or block, and the digits 1-9 shown in all_digits.
Each block and its missing elements will (between them) exactly cover the digits from 1 to 9 with no duplicates, and with each number appearing exactly once.
## Rows
all_digits = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]

Print all nine rows and row_missing_elements using the format:
row: [row], row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([row]) = [row_missing_elements]

Examples:
first_row: [1,0,3,4,5,6,0,0,9], first_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([1,0,3,4,5,6,0,0,9]) = [2,7,8]
second_row: [4,5,6,7,8,9,1,2,3], second_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([4,5,6,7,8,9,1,2,3]) = []
third_row: [7,8,0,1,2,3,4,5,6], third_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([7,8,0,1,2,3,4,5,6]) = [9]
fourth_row: [2,3,4,5,6,7,8,0,1], fourth_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([2,3,4,5,6,7,8,0,1]) = [9]
fifth_row: [5,6,7,8,9,1,2,3,4], fifth_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([5,6,7,8,9,1,2,3,4]) = []
sixth_row: [8,9,1,2,0,4,5,6,7], sixth_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([8,9,1,2,0,4,5,6,7]) = [3]
seventh_row: [3,4,5,6,7,8,9,1,2], seventh_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([3,4,5,6,7,8,9,1,2]) = []
eighth_row: [6,0,8,9,1,2,3,0,5], eighth_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([6,0,8,9,1,2,3,0,5]) = [4,7]
ninth_row: [9,0,2,0,4,5,0,7,8], ninth_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([9,0,2,0,4,5,0,7,8]) = [1,3,6]


## Columns
all_digits = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]

Format:
column: [column], column_missing_elements: [all_digits].difference([column]) = [column_missing_elements]

Examples:
first_column: [1,4,7,2,5,8,3,6,9] first_column_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([1,4,7,2,5,8,3,6,9]) = []
second_column: [0,5,8,3,6,9,4,0,0] second_column_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([0,5,8,3,6,9,4,0,0]) = [1,2,7]
third_column: [3,6,0,4,7,1,5,8,2] third_column_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([3,6,0,4,7,1,5,8,2]) = [9]
fourth_column: 

## Blocks
all_digits = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]

Format:
block: (rows: rows in the block; columns: columns in the block):
[block]
block_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([block]) = [block_missing_elements]

Examples:
top_left_block: (rows: first_row, second_row, third_row; columns: first_column, second_column, third_column)
[[1,0,3],
[4,5,6],
[7,8,0]]
top_left_block_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([1,0,3,4,5,6,7,8,0]) = [2,9]

top_middle_block: (rows: first_row, second_row, third_row; columns: fourth_column, fifth_column, sixth_column)
[[4,5,6],
[7,8,9],
[1,2,3]]
top_middle_block_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([4,5,6,7,8,9,1,2,3]) = []

top_right_block: (rows: first_row, second_row, third_row; columns: seventh_column, eighth_column, ninth_column)
[[0,0,9],
[1,2,3],
[4,5,6]]
top_right_block_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([0,0,9,1,2,3,4,5,6]) = [7,8]

middle_left_block: (rows: fourth_row, fifth_row, sixth_row; columns: first_column, second_column, third_column)



# Finding and counting the zero elements
## The positions of the zeroes
For each row we do the following calculations:
row_unfilled_indices: [row].index(0) = [index of every '0' element in the row]
row_unfilled_positions: row_unfilled_indices.increment(1) = [each index incremented by 1]
row_unfilled_columns: the word versions of the positions of the zeroes

Use the following format:
first_row_unfilled_indices: [1,0,3,4,5,6,0,0,9].index(0) = [1,6,7]
first_row_unfilled_positions: first_row_unfilled_indices.increment(1) = [2,7,8]
first_row_unfilled_columns: second, seventh, eighth


## Calculate the number of unfilled squares
A simple one line calculation By Hand to get the total number of unfilled squares:
total_unfilled_squares = 3 + 0 + 1 + 1 + 0 + 1 + 0 + 2 + 3 = 11

Then we cap the number of squares to list:
number_of_squares_to_list = min(total_unfilled_squares, 17) = 11



# Candidate analysis
## Common candidates in each unfilled square
Go through each unfilled square and list the missing elements for the row, column, and block containing that square (use the row and column to get the correct block).
Calculate the elements that are in Both the row, AND the column. Make sure to find ALL of them.
Then calculate the elements that are in Both STEP_A (the previous result), AND the block. Make sure to find ALL of them.

Make sure to ONLY do unfilled squares, which we calculated in the section 'The positions of the zeroes'.
For each unfilled square we examine, we do the following calculations (example below):
STEP_A = row_missing_elements.intersection(column_missing_elements) = [elements in both row_missing_elements AND column_missing_elements]
STEP_B = STEP_A.intersection(block_missing_elements) = [elements in both STEP_A AND block_missing_elements]
common_missing_elements: [STEP_B]
FOUND: square(row, column) (print this line if there is Only one common_missing_element in that square, otherwise leave this line blank and keep going)

Example:
### first_row_unfilled_columns: second, seventh, eighth
#### 1 of {number_of_squares_to_list}
(first_row, second_column):
Using first_row_missing_elements, second_column_missing_elements, and top_left_block_missing_elements (do not list the elements here, just the set names)
STEP_A: [2,7,8].intersection([1,2,7]) = [2,7]
STEP_B: [2,7].intersection([2,9]) = [2]
common_missing_elements: [2]
FOUND: square(first_row, second_column) (If the square has one only one common_missing_element, also print "FOUND ONE: square(row, column)" like this, then keep going)

When we have done as many unfilled squares as specified by number_of_squares_to_list, we stop listing squares and print:
"Finished printing 17 out of 17 squares" (using appropriate numbers)

# Outputting the found squares
## Collating Results
For Every unfilled square that had ONLY one common element (marked with "FOUND: square(row, column)"), we list them below so they are all in one place.

FOUND: square(first_row, second_column)

Make sure to list ALL of them

If there where none, instead print "There were no unfilled squares with only one common_missing_element"


## Unbiased Results
Finally, for every square in the results, we need to list them in the following format:
square(first_row, second_column)
first_row_missing_elements = [2,7,8]
second_column_missing_elements = [1,2,7]
top_left_block_missing_elements = [2,7]

Note that neither of the output sections lists the common_missing_element found in that square. This is to allow unbiased verification of the results.

Make sure to list all of them

If there where none, instead print "There are no candidate squares"

## Calculate the number of unfilled squares
total_unfilled_squares = 4 + 5 + 5 + 5 + 1 + 1 + 8 + 6 + 3 = 38

Then we cap the number of squares to list:
number_of_squares_to_list = min(total_unfilled_squares, 17) = 17

prompt 7 of 7:
# Task and background
- My previous message contains the last few hundred characters of a Sudoku analysis.
- You are examining the results in the "Unbiased Results" section of the previous message. Ignore all text before that section.
- The cells given in the section "Unbiased Results" are cells which were found to have only one possible candidate.
- However, the process which found the given cells will sometimes make mistakes, due to having to check so many cells at once.
- Your task is to use the given instructions to perform an independent verification or rejection of the given cells.
- Detailed instructions are provided below, but an overview is as follows:
    - Calculate the possible candidate elements for each cell using the method given below.
    - If a cell has multiple candidates, or fails some other given condition, reject that cell as a mistake made by the previous process.
- Complete all steps starting at STEP_ONE.


# STEP_ONE Extracting Previous Results
- Extract the results of the "Unbiased Results" section in the previous message.
- If there is no section marked "Unbiased Results" in the previous message, that means the start of it was cut off. In that case just start with the first complete cell you can see.
- Only take at most the first FOUR cells of the "Unbiased Results" section, as that's all the system can handle.
- Print the text from that section under the current heading "STEP_ONE Extracting Previous Results". Do not print the heading from the previous message.
- Note: When you print the text, change '_missing_elements' to '_candidates' for the row, column, and block for every cell. Everything else should remain the same.
- These cells will be used in STEP_TWO.


# STEP_TWO Calculating the candidates of each cell
- For each cell from STEP_ONE, use the following method to calculate the candidates of that cell.
- For each cell:
    - Loop through the digits 1 to 9
    - For each digit, count the number of times that digit appears in the row_candidates list, the column_candidates list, and the block_candidates lists.
    - On the same line, sum the row count, the column count, and the block count to get the total_count.
    - Most importantly, if the total_count is 3, immediately print "FOUND A THREE".
- At the end of each cell, find all the digits which had a total_count of 3 (marked by FOUND A THREE) and list them as the candidates of that cell.
- Everytime you complete a cell print "Cell {current cell number} of {number of cells} complete! {number of cells left} more to go!"
- Then move to the next cell until all are done.
- If there are more than 4 cells, cap the number to check at 4.

- Here is an example with the correct format:
## Cell 1 of {number of cells}
cell(first_row, second_column):
row = first_row_candidates = [1,2,4,6]
column = second_column_candidates = [2,5,6,7,8,9]
block = top_left_block_candidates = [1,2,3,4,6,7]

row.count(1) = 1, column.count(1) = 0, block.count(1) = 1, total_count(1) = 2
row.count(2) = 1, column.count(2) = 1, block.count(2) = 1, total_count(2) = 3 FOUND A THREE
row.count(3) = 0, column.count(3) = 0, block.count(3) = 1, total_count(3) = 1
row.count(4) = 1, column.count(4) = 0, block.count(4) = 1, total_count(4) = 2
row.count(5) = 0, column.count(5) = 1, block.count(5) = 0, total_count(5) = 1
row.count(6) = 1, column.count(6) = 1, block.count(6) = 1, total_count(6) = 3 FOUND A THREE
row.count(7) = 0, column.count(7) = 1, block.count(7) = 1, total_count(7) = 2
row.count(8) = 0, column.count(8) = 1, block.count(8) = 0, total_count(8) = 1
row.count(9) = 0, column.count(9) = 1, block.count(9) = 0, total_count(9) = 1

Confirmed candidates found for cell(first_row, second_column): [2,6]
Cell 1 of 3 complete! 2 more to go!!!

- After you have done All of the cells, list them in one place.
- Example:
## Candidates of the cells
cell(first_row, second_column): [2,6]
cell(second_row, eighth_column): [9]
cell(fourth_row, second_column): [1]

- Make sure to list All the cells, up to a maximum of 4


# STEP_THREE Checking the number of elements in each cell
- For each cell, count the number of elements in the candidates of that cell using .length().
- After each length, either print "length is 1, Passes" if the length is 1, or print "length is {length}, not 1, Rejected" if the length is Not one.
- Example:
cell(first_row, second_column): [2,6]
[2,6].length = number from 2
length is 2, not 1, Rejected

- After doing this for all the cells, list the cells which Passed, making sure Not to list any Rejected cells.
- Example:
## Passing Cells
cell(second_row, eighth_column): [9]
cell(fourth_row, second_column): [1]


# STEP_FOUR: Grouping Cells with Corresponding Rows
- Group each cell from the "Passing Cells" in STEP_THREE with their corresponding row from the current Sudoku. Do not update them yet.
- If there are no passing cells to update, print "There are no cells to update" and move to the next step.
- The current Sudoku is the second message I sent. Since it's so far back print it here (in the exact format it appears but without the output tags) to avoid confusing it with the examples.

- Example:
Current Sudoku:
{Current Sudoku Goes Here}

first_row: [0,3,0,0,8,0,4,9,0]
cell(first_row, fourth_column): [5]

fourth_row: [0,4,1,6,7,3,2,5,8]
cell(fourth_row, first_column): [9]

seventh_row: [2,0,4,0,0,0,0,8,0]
cell(seventh_row, eighth_column): [3]


# STEP_FIVE: Applying Cell Updates to Rows
- Now that the cells to update are cleanly grouped with the appropriate rows, confirm the column position and update each appropriate row.
- However, and this is VITAL: If the column position does NOT have a zero, IMMEDIATELY reject that cell and move on to the next.

- Example:
first_row: [0,3,0,0,8,0,4,9,0]
cell(first_row, fourth_column): [5]
The 4th position of the first_row is 0, so we can proceed.
Updating the value in the 4th position of the first_row:
updated_first_row: [0,3,0,5,8,0,4,9,0]

fourth_row: [0,4,1,6,7,3,2,5,8]
cell(fourth_row, first_column): [9]
The 1st position of the fourth_row is 0, so we can proceed.
Updating the value in the 1st position of the fourth_row:
updated_fourth_row: [9,4,1,6,7,3,2,5,8]

seventh_row: [2,0,4,0,0,0,0,8,0]
cell(seventh_row, eighth_column): [3]
The 8th position of the seventh_row is 8, WHICH IS NOT 0. This cell is rejected and will not be updated.


# STEP_SIX: Printing the Updated Sudoku
- Now print the Sudoku using the updated rows
- Specify the rows to update first to be sure they aren't forgotten. Do not include any rejected cells.

- Example:
The rows to update are first and fourth
updated_first_row: [0,3,0,5,8,0,4,9,0]
second_row: [0,9,2,0,4,1,0,0,0]
third_row: [0,6,0,7,0,9,0,0,5]
updated_fourth_row: [9,4,1,6,7,3,2,5,8]
fifth_row: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3]
sixth_row: [7,8,0,0,5,2,6,0,0]
seventh_row: [2,0,4,0,0,0,0,8,0]
eighth_row: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,4]
ninth_row: [0,1,0,0,3,0,0,2,0]


# Standardizing Row Names in the Updated Sudoku
- Print the Sudoku you just updated, but with the the original NAMES for the rows.
- Make sure the elements are from the UPDATED Sudoku in STEP_SIX.
- As there is now an old and an updated Sudoku, both of which look similar, write the following above the updated Sudoku
"The rows to fix the NAMES of are {rows to change}. The elements are the same as in STEP_SIX."

- Example:
The rows to fix the NAMES of are first and fourth. The elements are the same as in STEP_SIX.

first_row: [0,3,0,5,8,0,4,9,0]
second_row: [0,9,2,0,4,1,0,0,0]
third_row: [0,6,0,7,0,9,0,0,5]
fourth_row: [9,4,1,6,7,3,2,5,8]
fifth_row: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3]
sixth_row: [7,8,0,0,5,2,6,0,0]
seventh_row: [2,0,4,0,0,0,0,8,0]
eighth_row: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,4]
ninth_row: [0,1,0,0,3,0,0,2,0]

- Do not modify any other names in the Sudoku.


# STEP_SEVEN: Shifting the Rows of the Sudoku
- Before you output the Sudoku, the top three rows need to shifted to the bottom, like cutting a deck of cards.
- The rows to be in the order: fourth, fifth, sixth, seventh, eighth, ninth, first, second, third.

- Example:
fourth_row: [9,4,1,6,7,3,2,5,8]
fifth_row: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3]
sixth_row: [7,8,0,0,5,2,6,0,0]
seventh_row: [2,0,4,0,0,0,0,8,0]
eighth_row: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,4]
ninth_row: [0,1,0,0,3,0,0,2,0]
first_row: [0,3,0,5,8,0,4,9,0]
second_row: [0,9,2,0,4,1,0,0,0]
third_row: [0,6,0,7,0,9,0,0,5]


# STEP_EIGHT Fixing the Row Names and Outputting the Sudoku
- WITHOUT moving the elements of the Sudoku, standardize the row names.
- Also surround the Sudoku in output tags to clearly mark it as the output.
- Do not write ANYTHING after the closing output tag, as it will interfere with the system extracting your output.

- Example:
<Output>
first_row: [9,4,1,6,7,3,2,5,8]
second_row: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3]
third_row: [7,8,0,0,5,2,6,0,0]
fourth_row: [2,0,4,0,0,0,0,8,0]
fifth_row: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,4]
sixth_row: [0,1,0,0,3,0,0,2,0]
seventh_row: [0,3,0,5,8,0,4,9,0]
eighth_row: [0,9,2,0,4,1,0,0,0]
ninth_row: [0,6,0,7,0,9,0,0,5]
</Output>


# Final notes
- Ensure all outputs are clearly labeled using the simple headers provided in the instructions.
- Do not use code blocks. Just plain text with the headers in the instructions is fine.
- Stop ONLY after completing STEP_EIGHT, writing NOTHING ELSE after you write the final closing output tag.
- Begin

prompt 3 of 3:
You are going to analyze the sudoku you've just been given.
The analysis will come down to one thing, finding the candidate elements for each unfilled square.
To do this, examine the nine rows, the nine columns, and the nine blocks, and find the elements missing from each set.
Then, for each unfilled square (squares with a '0'), examine the elements missing from the row, column, and 3-by-3 block associated with that square, combine them into a set of common candidates, and check to see whether or not there is Exactly one candidate in that set. Everything else follows from that.



# Board State
Trying to play without vision is difficult, so I want you to follow a very specific format.
I want you to print out the current board state using the _exact_ format shown below (replace the example with the current sudoku).
We are also finding the missing elements of each set. So we are taking the current row, column, or block, and calculating the set-wise difference between that row, column, or block, and the digits 1-9 shown in all_digits.
Each block and its missing elements will (between them) exactly cover the digits from 1 to 9 with no duplicates, and with each number appearing exactly once.
## Rows
all_digits = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]

Print all nine rows and row_missing_elements using the format:
row: [row], row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([row]) = [row_missing_elements]

Examples:
first_row: [1,0,3,4,5,6,0,0,9], first_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([1,0,3,4,5,6,0,0,9]) = [2,7,8]
second_row: [4,5,6,7,8,9,1,2,3], second_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([4,5,6,7,8,9,1,2,3]) = []
third_row: [7,8,0,1,2,3,4,5,6], third_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([7,8,0,1,2,3,4,5,6]) = [9]
fourth_row: [2,3,4,5,6,7,8,0,1], fourth_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([2,3,4,5,6,7,8,0,1]) = [9]
fifth_row: [5,6,7,8,9,1,2,3,4], fifth_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([5,6,7,8,9,1,2,3,4]) = []
sixth_row: [8,9,1,2,0,4,5,6,7], sixth_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([8,9,1,2,0,4,5,6,7]) = [3]
seventh_row: [3,4,5,6,7,8,9,1,2], seventh_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([3,4,5,6,7,8,9,1,2]) = []
eighth_row: [6,0,8,9,1,2,3,0,5], eighth_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([6,0,8,9,1,2,3,0,5]) = [4,7]
ninth_row: [9,0,2,0,4,5,0,7,8], ninth_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([9,0,2,0,4,5,0,7,8]) = [1,3,6]


## Columns
all_digits = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]

Format:
column: [column], column_missing_elements: [all_digits].difference([column]) = [column_missing_elements]

Examples:
first_column: [1,4,7,2,5,8,3,6,9] first_column_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([1,4,7,2,5,8,3,6,9]) = []
second_column: [0,5,8,3,6,9,4,0,0] second_column_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([0,5,8,3,6,9,4,0,0]) = [1,2,7]
third_column: [3,6,0,4,7,1,5,8,2] third_column_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([3,6,0,4,7,1,5,8,2]) = [9]
fourth_column: 

## Blocks
all_digits = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]

Format:
block: (rows: rows in the block; columns: columns in the block):
[block]
block_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([block]) = [block_missing_elements]

Examples:
top_left_block: (rows: first_row, second_row, third_row; columns: first_column, second_column, third_column)
[[1,0,3],
[4,5,6],
[7,8,0]]
top_left_block_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([1,0,3,4,5,6,7,8,0]) = [2,9]

top_middle_block: (rows: first_row, second_row, third_row; columns: fourth_column, fifth_column, sixth_column)
[[4,5,6],
[7,8,9],
[1,2,3]]
top_middle_block_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([4,5,6,7,8,9,1,2,3]) = []

top_right_block: (rows: first_row, second_row, third_row; columns: seventh_column, eighth_column, ninth_column)
[[0,0,9],
[1,2,3],
[4,5,6]]
top_right_block_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([0,0,9,1,2,3,4,5,6]) = [7,8]

middle_left_block: (rows: fourth_row, fifth_row, sixth_row; columns: first_column, second_column, third_column)



# Finding and counting the zero elements
## The positions of the zeroes
For each row we do the following calculations:
row_unfilled_indices: [row].index(0) = [index of every '0' element in the row]
row_unfilled_positions: row_unfilled_indices.increment(1) = [each index incremented by 1]
row_unfilled_columns: the word versions of the positions of the zeroes

Use the following format:
first_row_unfilled_indices: [1,0,3,4,5,6,0,0,9].index(0) = [1,6,7]
first_row_unfilled_positions: first_row_unfilled_indices.increment(1) = [2,7,8]
first_row_unfilled_columns: second, seventh, eighth


## Calculate the number of unfilled squares
A simple one line calculation By Hand to get the total number of unfilled squares:
total_unfilled_squares = 3 + 0 + 1 + 1 + 0 + 1 + 0 + 2 + 3 = 11

Then we cap the number of squares to list:
number_of_squares_to_list = min(total_unfilled_squares, 17) = 11



# Candidate analysis
## Common candidates in each unfilled square
Go through each unfilled square and list the missing elements for the row, column, and block containing that square (use the row and column to get the correct block).
Calculate the elements that are in Both the row, AND the column. Make sure to find ALL of them.
Then calculate the elements that are in Both STEP_A (the previous result), AND the block. Make sure to find ALL of them.

Make sure to ONLY do unfilled squares, which we calculated in the section 'The positions of the zeroes'.
For each unfilled square we examine, we do the following calculations (example below):
STEP_A = row_missing_elements.intersection(column_missing_elements) = [elements in both row_missing_elements AND column_missing_elements]
STEP_B = STEP_A.intersection(block_missing_elements) = [elements in both STEP_A AND block_missing_elements]
common_missing_elements: [STEP_B]
FOUND: square(row, column) (print this line if there is Only one common_missing_element in that square, otherwise leave this line blank and keep going)

Example:
### first_row_unfilled_columns: second, seventh, eighth
#### 1 of {number_of_squares_to_list}
(first_row, second_column):
Using first_row_missing_elements, second_column_missing_elements, and top_left_block_missing_elements (do not list the elements here, just the set names)
STEP_A: [2,7,8].intersection([1,2,7]) = [2,7]
STEP_B: [2,7].intersection([2,9]) = [2]
common_missing_elements: [2]
FOUND: square(first_row, second_column) (If the square has one only one common_missing_element, also print "FOUND ONE: square(row, column)" like this, then keep going)

When we have done as many unfilled squares as specified by number_of_squares_to_list, we stop listing squares and print:
"Finished printing 17 out of 17 squares" (using appropriate numbers)

# Outputting the found squares
## Collating Results
For Every unfilled square that had ONLY one common element (marked with "FOUND: square(row, column)"), we list them below so they are all in one place.

FOUND: square(first_row, second_column)

Make sure to list ALL of them

If there where none, instead print "There were no unfilled squares with only one common_missing_element"


## Unbiased Results
Finally, for every square in the results, we need to list them in the following format:
square(first_row, second_column)
first_row_missing_elements = [2,7,8]
second_column_missing_elements = [1,2,7]
top_left_block_missing_elements = [2,7]

Note that neither of the output sections lists the common_missing_element found in that square. This is to allow unbiased verification of the results.

Make sure to list all of them

If there where none, instead print "There are no candidate squares"

Follow ALL instructions METHODICALLY and IN FULL. Your task is to calculate the possible candidate elements for the given cells, then to update the non-rejected cells of the given sudoku using the calculated candidate elements, then to shift the rows, and finally to output the updated and shifted sudoku. Once you begin you must complete ALL of these tasks BEFORE stopping. After receiving the full instructions you have ONLY one message to finish the task, as soon as you stop responding the final section of your response is sent to the next part of the process. Thus the final text you write MUST be the updated and shifted Sudoku, in the correct format, after ALL other sections have been completed. Begin as soon as you receive the full instruction set.

Respond to this message with "Awaiting instructions." and nothing else. When you receive the current sudoku in <output> tags, say only "Awaiting instructions." and nothing else. You will then receive the last few hundred characters of the previous analysis results. When you receive the previous results say "Awaiting instructions." and nothing else. You will then receive instructions. When you receive the instructions, you may begin.

# Task and background
- My previous message contains the last few hundred characters of a Sudoku analysis.
- You are examining the results in the "Unbiased Results" section of the previous message. Ignore all text before that section.
- The cells given in the section "Unbiased Results" are cells which were found to have only one possible candidate.
- However, the process which found the given cells will sometimes make mistakes, due to having to check so many cells at once.
- Your task is to use the given instructions to perform an independent verification or rejection of the given cells.
- Detailed instructions are provided below, but an overview is as follows:
    - Calculate the possible candidate elements for each cell using the method given below.
    - If a cell has multiple candidates, or fails some other given condition, reject that cell as a mistake made by the previous process.
- Complete all steps starting at STEP_ONE.


# STEP_ONE Extracting Previous Results
- Extract the results of the "Unbiased Results" section in the previous message.
- If there is no section marked "Unbiased Results" in the previous message, that means the start of it was cut off. In that case just start with the first complete cell you can see.
- Only take at most the first FOUR cells of the "Unbiased Results" section, as that's all the system can handle.
- Print the text from that section under the current heading "STEP_ONE Extracting Previous Results". Do not print the heading from the previous message.
- Note: When you print the text, change '_missing_elements' to '_candidates' for the row, column, and block for every cell. Everything else should remain the same.
- These cells will be used in STEP_TWO.


# STEP_TWO Calculating the candidates of each cell
- For each cell from STEP_ONE, use the following method to calculate the candidates of that cell.
- For each cell:
    - Loop through the digits 1 to 9
    - For each digit, count the number of times that digit appears in the row_candidates list, the column_candidates list, and the block_candidates lists.
    - On the same line, sum the row count, the column count, and the block count to get the total_count.
    - Most importantly, if the total_count is 3, immediately print "FOUND A THREE".
- At the end of each cell, find all the digits which had a total_count of 3 (marked by FOUND A THREE) and list them as the candidates of that cell.
- Everytime you complete a cell print "Cell {current cell number} of {number of cells} complete! {number of cells left} more to go!"
- Then move to the next cell until all are done.
- If there are more than 4 cells, cap the number to check at 4.

- Here is an example with the correct format:
## Cell 1 of {number of cells}
cell(first_row, second_column):
row = first_row_candidates = [1,2,4,6]
column = second_column_candidates = [2,5,6,7,8,9]
block = top_left_block_candidates = [1,2,3,4,6,7]

row.count(1) = 1, column.count(1) = 0, block.count(1) = 1, total_count(1) = 2

Confirmed candidates found for cell(first_row, second_column): [2,6]
Cell 1 of 3 complete! 2 more to go!!!

- After you have done All of the cells, list them in one place.
- Example:
## Candidates of the cells
cell(first_row, second_column): [2,6]
cell(second_row, eighth_column): [9]
cell(fourth_row, second_column): [1]

- Make sure to list All the cells, up to a maximum of 4


# STEP_THREE Checking the number of elements in each cell
- For each cell, count the number of elements in the candidates of that cell using .length().
- After each length, either print "length is 1, Passes" if the length is 1, or print "length is {length}, not 1, Rejected" if the length is Not one.
- Example:
cell(first_row, second_column): [2,6]
[2,6].length = number from 2
length is 2, not 1, Rejected

- After doing this for all the cells, list the cells which Passed, making sure Not to list any Rejected cells.
- Example:
## Passing Cells
cell(second_row, eighth_column): [9]
cell(fourth_row, second_column): [1]


# STEP_FOUR: Grouping Cells with Corresponding Rows
- Group each cell from the "Passing Cells" in STEP_THREE with their corresponding row from the current Sudoku. Do not update them yet.
- If there are no passing cells to update, print "There are no cells to update" and move to the next step.
- The current Sudoku is the second message I sent. Since it's so far back print it here (in the exact format it appears but without the output tags) to avoid confusing it with the examples.

- Example:
Current Sudoku:
{Current Sudoku Goes Here}

first_row: [0,3,0,0,8,0,4,9,0]
cell(first_row, fourth_column): [5]

fourth_row: [0,4,1,6,7,3,2,5,8]
cell(fourth_row, first_column): [9]

seventh_row: [2,0,4,0,0,0,0,8,0]
cell(seventh_row, eighth_column): [3]


# STEP_FIVE: Applying Cell Updates to Rows
- Now that the cells to update are cleanly grouped with the appropriate rows, confirm the column position and update each appropriate row.
- However, and this is VITAL: If the column position does NOT have a zero, IMMEDIATELY reject that cell and move on to the next.

- Example:
first_row: [0,3,0,0,8,0,4,9,0]
cell(first_row, fourth_column): [5]
The 4th position of the first_row is 0, so we can proceed.
Updating the value in the 4th position of the first_row:
updated_first_row: [0,3,0,5,8,0,4,9,0]

fourth_row: [0,4,1,6,7,3,2,5,8]
cell(fourth_row, first_column): [9]
The 1st position of the fourth_row is 0, so we can proceed.
Updating the value in the 1st position of the fourth_row:
updated_fourth_row: [9,4,1,6,7,3,2,5,8]

seventh_row: [2,0,4,0,0,0,0,8,0]
cell(seventh_row, eighth_column): [3]
The 8th position of the seventh_row is 8, WHICH IS NOT 0. This cell is rejected and will not be updated.


# STEP_SIX: Printing the Updated Sudoku
- Now print the Sudoku using the updated rows
- Specify the rows to update first to be sure they aren't forgotten. Do not include any rejected cells.

- Example:
The rows to update are first and fourth
updated_first_row: [0,3,0,5,8,0,4,9,0]
second_row: [0,9,2,0,4,1,0,0,0]
third_row: [0,6,0,7,0,9,0,0,5]
updated_fourth_row: [9,4,1,6,7,3,2,5,8]
fifth_row: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3]
sixth_row: [7,8,0,0,5,2,6,0,0]
seventh_row: [2,0,4,0,0,0,0,8,0]
eighth_row: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,4]
ninth_row: [0,1,0,0,3,0,0,2,0]


# Standardizing Row Names in the Updated Sudoku
- Print the Sudoku you just updated, but with the the original NAMES for the rows.
- Make sure the elements are from the UPDATED Sudoku in STEP_SIX.
- As there is now an old and an updated Sudoku, both of which look similar, write the following above the updated Sudoku
"The rows to fix the NAMES of are {rows to change}. The elements are the same as in STEP_SIX."

- Example:
The rows to fix the NAMES of are first and fourth. The elements are the same as in STEP_SIX.

first_row: [0,3,0,5,8,0,4,9,0]
second_row: [0,9,2,0,4,1,0,0,0]
third_row: [0,6,0,7,0,9,0,0,5]
fourth_row: [9,4,1,6,7,3,2,5,8]
fifth_row: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3]
sixth_row: [7,8,0,0,5,2,6,0,0]
seventh_row: [2,0,4,0,0,0,0,8,0]
eighth_row: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,4]
ninth_row: [0,1,0,0,3,0,0,2,0]

- Do not modify any other names in the Sudoku.


# STEP_SEVEN: Shifting the Rows of the Sudoku
- Before you output the Sudoku, the top three rows need to shifted to the bottom, like cutting a deck of cards.
- The rows to be in the order: fourth, fifth, sixth, seventh, eighth, ninth, first, second, third.

- Example:
fourth_row: [9,4,1,6,7,3,2,5,8]
fifth_row: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3]
sixth_row: [7,8,0,0,5,2,6,0,0]
seventh_row: [2,0,4,0,0,0,0,8,0]
eighth_row: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,4]
ninth_row: [0,1,0,0,3,0,0,2,0]
first_row: [0,3,0,5,8,0,4,9,0]
second_row: [0,9,2,0,4,1,0,0,0]
third_row: [0,6,0,7,0,9,0,0,5]


# STEP_EIGHT Fixing the Row Names and Outputting the Sudoku
- WITHOUT moving the elements of the Sudoku, standardize the row names.
- Also surround the Sudoku in output tags to clearly mark it as the output.
- Do not write ANYTHING after the closing output tag, as it will interfere with the system extracting your output.

- Example:
<Output>
first_row: [9,4,1,6,7,3,2,5,8]
second_row: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3]
third_row: [7,8,0,0,5,2,6,0,0]
fourth_row: [2,0,4,0,0,0,0,8,0]
fifth_row: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,4]
sixth_row: [0,1,0,0,3,0,0,2,0]
seventh_row: [0,3,0,5,8,0,4,9,0]
eighth_row: [0,9,2,0,4,1,0,0,0]
ninth_row: [0,6,0,7,0,9,0,0,5]
</Output>


# Final notes
- Ensure all outputs are clearly labeled using the simple headers provided in the instructions.
- Do not use code blocks. Just plain text with the headers in the instructions is fine.
- Stop ONLY after completing STEP_EIGHT, writing NOTHING ELSE after you write the final closing output tag.
- Begin

prompt 3 of 3:
You are going to analyze the sudoku you've just been given.
The analysis will come down to one thing, finding the candidate elements for each unfilled square.
To do this, examine the nine rows, the nine columns, and the nine blocks, and find the elements missing from each set.
Then, for each unfilled square (squares with a '0'), examine the elements missing from the row, column, and 3-by-3 block associated with that square, combine them into a set of common candidates, and check to see whether or not there is Exactly one candidate in that set. Everything else follows from that.



# Board State
Trying to play without vision is difficult, so I want you to follow a very specific format.
I want you to print out the current board state using the _exact_ format shown below (replace the example with the current sudoku).
We are also finding the missing elements of each set. So we are taking the current row, column, or block, and calculating the set-wise difference between that row, column, or block, and the digits 1-9 shown in all_digits.
Each block and its missing elements will (between them) exactly cover the digits from 1 to 9 with no duplicates, and with each number appearing exactly once.
## Rows
all_digits = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]

Print all nine rows and row_missing_elements using the format:
row: [row], row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([row]) = [row_missing_elements]

Examples:
first_row: [1,0,3,4,5,6,0,0,9], first_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([1,0,3,4,5,6,0,0,9]) = [2,7,8]
second_row: [4,5,6,7,8,9,1,2,3], second_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([4,5,6,7,8,9,1,2,3]) = []
third_row: [7,8,0,1,2,3,4,5,6], third_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([7,8,0,1,2,3,4,5,6]) = [9]
fourth_row: [2,3,4,5,6,7,8,0,1], fourth_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([2,3,4,5,6,7,8,0,1]) = [9]

# Finding and counting the zero elements
## The positions of the zeroes
For each row we do the following calculations:
row_unfilled_indices: [row].index(0) = [index of every '0' element in the row]
row_unfilled_positions: row_unfilled_indices.increment(1) = [each index incremented by 1]
row_unfilled_columns: the word versions of the positions of the zeroes

Use the following format:
first_row_unfilled_indices: [1,0,3,4,5,6,0,0,9].index(0) = [1,6,7]
first_row_unfilled_positions: first_row_unfilled_indices.increment(1) = [2,7,8]
first_row_unfilled_columns: second, seventh, eighth


## Calculate the number of unfilled squares
A simple one line calculation By Hand to get the total number of unfilled squares:
total_unfilled_squares = 3 + 0 + 1 + 1 + 0 + 1 + 0 + 2 + 3 = 11

Then we cap the number of squares to list:
number_of_squares_to_list = min(total_unfilled_squares, 17) = 11



# Candidate analysis
## Common candidates in each unfilled square
Go through each unfilled square and list the missing elements for the row, column, and block containing that square (use the row and column to get the correct block).
Calculate the elements that are in Both the row, AND the column. Make sure to find ALL of them.
Then calculate the elements that are in Both STEP_A (the previous result), AND the block. Make sure to find ALL of them.

Make sure to ONLY do unfilled squares, which we calculated in the section 'The positions of the zeroes'.
For each unfilled square we examine, we do the following calculations (example below):
STEP_A = row_missing_elements.intersection(column_missing_elements) = [elements in both row_missing_elements AND column_missing_elements]
STEP_B = STEP_A.intersection(block_missing_elements) = [elements in both STEP_A AND block_missing_elements]
common_missing_elements: [STEP_B]
FOUND: square(row, column) (print this line if there is Only one common_missing_element in that square, otherwise leave this line blank and keep going)

Example:
### first_row_unfilled_columns: second, seventh, eighth
#### 1 of {number_of_squares_to_list}
(first_row, second_column):
Using first_row_missing_elements, second_column_missing_elements, and top_left_block_missing_elements (do not list the elements here, just the set names)
STEP_A: [2,7,8].intersection([1,2,7]) = [2,7]
STEP_B: [2,7].intersection([2,9]) = [2]
common_missing_elements: [2]
FOUND: square(first_row, second_column) (If the square has one only one common_missing_element, also print "FOUND ONE: square(row, column)" like this, then keep going)

When we have done as many unfilled squares as specified by number_of_squares_to_list, we stop listing squares and print:
"Finished printing 17 out of 17 squares" (using appropriate numbers)

# Outputting the found squares
## Collating Results
For Every unfilled square that had ONLY one common element (marked with "FOUND: square(row, column)"), we list them below so they are all in one place.

FOUND: square(first_row, second_column)

Make sure to list ALL of them

If there where none, instead print "There were no unfilled squares with only one common_missing_element"


## Unbiased Results
Finally, for every square in the results, we need to list them in the following format:
square(first_row, second_column)
first_row_missing_elements = [2,7,8]
second_column_missing_elements = [1,2,7]
top_left_block_missing_elements = [2,7]

Note that neither of the output sections lists the common_missing_element found in that square. This is to allow unbiased verification of the results.

Make sure to list all of them

If there where none, instead print "There are no candidate squares"

Once you begin you must complete ALL of these tasks BEFORE stopping. After receiving the full instructions you have ONLY one message to finish the task, as soon as you stop responding the final section of your response is sent to the next part of the process. Thus the final text you write MUST be the updated and shifted Sudoku, in the correct format, after ALL other sections have been completed. Begin as soon as you receive the full instruction set.

prompt 1 of 7:
Respond to this message with "Awaiting instructions." and nothing else. When you receive the current sudoku in <output> tags, say only "Awaiting instructions." and nothing else. You will then receive the last few hundred characters of the previous analysis results. When you receive the previous results say "Awaiting instructions." and nothing else. You will then receive instructions. When you receive the instructions, you may begin.

prompt 7 of 7:
# Task and background
- My previous message contains the last few hundred characters of a Sudoku analysis.
- You are examining the results in the "Unbiased Results" section of the previous message. Ignore all text before that section.
- The cells given in the section "Unbiased Results" are cells which were found to have only one possible candidate.
- However, the process which found the given cells will sometimes make mistakes, due to having to check so many cells at once.
- Your task is to use the given instructions to perform an independent verification or rejection of the given cells.
- Detailed instructions are provided below, but an overview is as follows:
    - Calculate the possible candidate elements for each cell using the method given below.
    - If a cell has multiple candidates, or fails some other given condition, reject that cell as a mistake made by the previous process.
- Complete all steps starting at STEP_ONE.


# STEP_ONE Extracting Previous Results
- Extract the results of the "Unbiased Results" section in the previous message.
- If there is no section marked "Unbiased Results" in the previous message, that means the start of it was cut off. In that case just start with the first complete cell you can see.
- Only take at most the first FOUR cells of the "Unbiased Results" section, as that's all the system can handle.
- Print the text from that section under the current heading "STEP_ONE Extracting Previous Results". Do not print the heading from the previous message.
- Note: When you print the text, change '_missing_elements' to '_candidates' for the row, column, and block for every cell. Everything else should remain the same.
- These cells will be used in STEP_TWO.


# STEP_TWO Calculating the candidates of each cell
- For each cell from STEP_ONE, use the following method to calculate the candidates of that cell.
- For each cell:
    - Loop through the digits 1 to 9
    - For each digit, count the number of times that digit appears in the row_candidates list, the column_candidates list, and the block_candidates lists.
    - On the same line, sum the row count, the column count, and the block count to get the total_count.
    - Most importantly, if the total_count is 3, immediately print "FOUND A THREE".
- At the end of each cell, find all the digits which had a total_count of 3 (marked by FOUND A THREE) and list them as the candidates of that cell.
- Everytime you complete a cell print "Cell {current cell number} of {number of cells} complete! {number of cells left} more to go!"
- Then move to the next cell until all are done.
- If there are more than 4 cells, cap the number to check at 4.

- Here is an example with the correct format:
## Cell 1 of {number of cells}
cell(first_row, second_column):
row = first_row_candidates = [1,2,4,6]
column = second_column_candidates = [2,5,6,7,8,9]
block = top_left_block_candidates = [1,2,3,4,6,7]

row.count(1) = 1, column.count(1) = 0, block.count(1) = 1, total_count(1) = 2
row.count(2) = 1, column.count(2) = 1, block.count(2) = 1, total_count(2) = 3 FOUND A THREE
row.count(3) = 0, column.count(3) = 0, block.count(3) = 1, total_count(3) = 1
row.count(4) = 1, column.count(4) = 0, block.count(4) = 1, total_count(4) = 2
row.count(5) = 0, column.count(5) = 1, block.count(5) = 0, total_count(5) = 1
row.count(6) = 1, column.count(6) = 1, block.count(6) = 1, total_count(6) = 3 FOUND A THREE
row.count(7) = 0, column.count(7) = 1, block.count(7) = 1, total_count(7) = 2
row.count(8) = 0, column.count(8) = 1, block.count(8) = 0, total_count(8) = 1
row.count(9) = 0, column.count(9) = 1, block.count(9) = 0, total_count(9) = 1

Confirmed candidates found for cell(first_row, second_column): [2,6]
Cell 1 of 3 complete! 2 more to go!!!

- After you have done All of the cells, list them in one place.
- Example:
## Candidates of the cells
cell(first_row, second_column): [2,6]
cell(second_row, eighth_column): [9]
cell(fourth_row, second_column): [1]

- Make sure to list All the cells, up to a maximum of 4


# STEP_THREE Checking the number of elements in each cell
- For each cell, count the number of elements in the candidates of that cell using .length().
- After each length, either print "length is 1, Passes" if the length is 1, or print "length is {length}, not 1, Rejected" if the length is Not one.
- Example:
cell(first_row, second_column): [2,6]
[2,6].length = number from 2
length is 2, not 1, Rejected

- After doing this for all the cells, list the cells which Passed, making sure Not to list any Rejected cells.
- Example:
## Passing Cells
cell(second_row, eighth_column): [9]
cell(fourth_row, second_column): [1]


# STEP_FOUR: Grouping Cells with Corresponding Rows
- Group each cell from the "Passing Cells" in STEP_THREE with their corresponding row from the current Sudoku. Do not update them yet.
- If there are no passing cells to update, print "There are no cells to update" and move to the next step.
- The current Sudoku is the second message I sent. Since it's so far back print it here (in the exact format it appears but without the output tags) to avoid confusing it with the examples.

- Example:
Current Sudoku:
{Current Sudoku Goes Here}

first_row: [0,3,0,0,8,0,4,9,0]
cell(first_row, fourth_column): [5]

fourth_row: [0,4,1,6,7,3,2,5,8]
cell(fourth_row, first_column): [9]

seventh_row: [2,0,4,0,0,0,0,8,0]
cell(seventh_row, eighth_column): [3]


# STEP_FIVE: Applying Cell Updates to Rows
- Now that the cells to update are cleanly grouped with the appropriate rows, confirm the column position and update each appropriate row.
- However, and this is VITAL: If the column position does NOT have a zero, IMMEDIATELY reject that cell and move on to the next.

- Example:
first_row: [0,3,0,0,8,0,4,9,0]
cell(first_row, fourth_column): [5]
The 4th position of the first_row is 0, so we can proceed.
Updating the value in the 4th position of the first_row:
updated_first_row: [0,3,0,5,8,0,4,9,0]

fourth_row: [0,4,1,6,7,3,2,5,8]
cell(fourth_row, first_column): [9]
The 1st position of the fourth_row is 0, so we can proceed.
Updating the value in the 1st position of the fourth_row:
updated_fourth_row: [9,4,1,6,7,3,2,5,8]

seventh_row: [2,0,4,0,0,0,0,8,0]
cell(seventh_row, eighth_column): [3]
The 8th position of the seventh_row is 8, WHICH IS NOT 0. This cell is rejected and will not be updated.


# STEP_SIX: Printing the Updated Sudoku
- Now print the Sudoku using the updated rows
- Specify the rows to update first to be sure they aren't forgotten. Do not include any rejected cells.

- Example:
The rows to update are first and fourth
updated_first_row: [0,3,0,5,8,0,4,9,0]
second_row: [0,9,2,0,4,1,0,0,0]
third_row: [0,6,0,7,0,9,0,0,5]
updated_fourth_row: [9,4,1,6,7,3,2,5,8]
fifth_row: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3]
sixth_row: [7,8,0,0,5,2,6,0,0]
seventh_row: [2,0,4,0,0,0,0,8,0]
eighth_row: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,4]
ninth_row: [0,1,0,0,3,0,0,2,0]


# Standardizing Row Names in the Updated Sudoku
- Print the Sudoku you just updated, but with the the original NAMES for the rows.
- Make sure the elements are from the UPDATED Sudoku in STEP_SIX.
- As there is now an old and an updated Sudoku, both of which look similar, write the following above the updated Sudoku
"The rows to fix the NAMES of are {rows to change}. The elements are the same as in STEP_SIX."

- Example:
The rows to fix the NAMES of are first and fourth. The elements are the same as in STEP_SIX.

first_row: [0,3,0,5,8,0,4,9,0]
second_row: [0,9,2,0,4,1,0,0,0]
third_row: [0,6,0,7,0,9,0,0,5]
fourth_row: [9,4,1,6,7,3,2,5,8]
fifth_row: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3]
sixth_row: [7,8,0,0,5,2,6,0,0]
seventh_row: [2,0,4,0,0,0,0,8,0]
eighth_row: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,4]
ninth_row: [0,1,0,0,3,0,0,2,0]

- Do not modify any other names in the Sudoku.


# STEP_SEVEN: Shifting the Rows of the Sudoku
- Before you output the Sudoku, the top three rows need to shifted to the bottom, like cutting a deck of cards.
- The rows to be in the order: fourth, fifth, sixth, seventh, eighth, ninth, first, second, third.

- Example:
fourth_row: [9,4,1,6,7,3,2,5,8]
fifth_row: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3]
sixth_row: [7,8,0,0,5,2,6,0,0]
seventh_row: [2,0,4,0,0,0,0,8,0]
eighth_row: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,4]
ninth_row: [0,1,0,0,3,0,0,2,0]
first_row: [0,3,0,5,8,0,4,9,0]
second_row: [0,9,2,0,4,1,0,0,0]
third_row: [0,6,0,7,0,9,0,0,5]


# STEP_EIGHT Fixing the Row Names and Outputting the Sudoku
- WITHOUT moving the elements of the Sudoku, standardize the row names.
- Also surround the Sudoku in output tags to clearly mark it as the output.
- Do not write ANYTHING after the closing output tag, as it will interfere with the system extracting your output.

- Example:
<Output>
first_row: [9,4,1,6,7,3,2,5,8]
second_row: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3]
third_row: [7,8,0,0,5,2,6,0,0]
fourth_row: [2,0,4,0,0,0,0,8,0]
fifth_row: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,4]
sixth_row: [0,1,0,0,3,0,0,2,0]
seventh_row: [0,3,0,5,8,0,4,9,0]
eighth_row: [0,9,2,0,4,1,0,0,0]
ninth_row: [0,6,0,7,0,9,0,0,5]
</Output>


# Final notes
- Ensure all outputs are clearly labeled using the simple headers provided in the instructions.
- Do not use code blocks. Just plain text with the headers in the instructions is fine.
- Stop ONLY after completing STEP_EIGHT, writing NOTHING ELSE after you write the final closing output tag.
- Begin

prompt 3 of 3:
You are going to analyze the sudoku you've just been given.
The analysis will come down to one thing, finding the candidate elements for each unfilled square.
To do this, examine the nine rows, the nine columns, and the nine blocks, and find the elements missing from each set.
Then, for each unfilled square (squares with a '0'), examine the elements missing from the row, column, and 3-by-3 block associated with that square, combine them into a set of common candidates, and check to see whether or not there is Exactly one candidate in that set. Everything else follows from that.



# Board State
Trying to play without vision is difficult, so I want you to follow a very specific format.
I want you to print out the current board state using the _exact_ format shown below (replace the example with the current sudoku).
We are also finding the missing elements of each set. So we are taking the current row, column, or block, and calculating the set-wise difference between that row, column, or block, and the digits 1-9 shown in all_digits.
Each block and its missing elements will (between them) exactly cover the digits from 1 to 9 with no duplicates, and with each number appearing exactly once.
## Rows
all_digits = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]

Print all nine rows and row_missing_elements using the format:
row: [row], row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([row]) = [row_missing_elements]

Examples:
first_row: [1,0,3,4,5,6,0,0,9], first_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([1,0,3,4,5,6,0,0,9]) = [2,7,8]
second_row: [4,5,6,7,8,9,1,2,3], second_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([4,5,6,7,8,9,1,2,3]) = []
third_row: [7,8,0,1,2,3,4,5,6], third_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([7,8,0,1,2,3,4,5,6]) = [9]
fourth_row: [2,3,4,5,6,7,8,0,1], fourth_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([2,3,4,5,6,7,8,0,1]) = [9]
fifth_row: [5,6,7,8,9,1,2,3,4], fifth_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([5,6,7,8,9,1,2,3,4]) = []
sixth_row: [8,9,1,2,0,4,5,6,7], sixth_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([8,9,1,2,0,4,5,6,7]) = [3]

eighth_row: [6,0,8,9,1,2,3,0,5], eighth_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([6,0,8,9,1,2,3,0,5]) = [4,7]
ninth_row: [9,0,2,0,4,5,0,7,8], ninth_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([9,0,2,0,4,5,0,7,8]) = [1,3,6]


## Columns
all_digits = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]

Format:
column: [column], column_missing_elements: [all_digits].difference([column]) = [column_missing_elements]

Examples:
first_column: [1,4,7,2,5,8,3,6,9] first_column_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([1,4,7,2,5,8,3,6,9]) = []
second_column: [0,5,8,3,6,9,4,0,0] second_column_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([0,5,8,3,6,9,4,0,0]) = [1,2,7]

# Finding and counting the zero elements
## The positions of the zeroes
For each row we do the following calculations:
row_unfilled_indices: [row].index(0) = [index of every '0' element in the row]
row_unfilled_positions: row_unfilled_indices.increment(1) = [each index incremented by 1]
row_unfilled_columns: the word versions of the positions of the zeroes

Use the following format:
first_row_unfilled_indices: [1,0,3,4,5,6,0,0,9].index(0) = [1,6,7]
first_row_unfilled_positions: first_row_unfilled_indices.increment(1) = [2,7,8]
first_row_unfilled_columns: second, seventh, eighth


## Calculate the number of unfilled squares
A simple one line calculation By Hand to get the total number of unfilled squares:
total_unfilled_squares = 3 + 0 + 1 + 1 + 0 + 1 + 0 + 2 + 3 = 11

Then we cap the number of squares to list:
number_of_squares_to_list = min(total_unfilled_squares, 17) = 11



# Candidate analysis
## Common candidates in each unfilled square
Go through each unfilled square and list the missing elements for the row, column, and block containing that square (use the row and column to get the correct block).
Calculate the elements that are in Both the row, AND the column. Make sure to find ALL of them.
Then calculate the elements that are in Both STEP_A (the previous result), AND the block. Make sure to find ALL of them.

Make sure to ONLY do unfilled squares, which we calculated in the section 'The positions of the zeroes'.
For each unfilled square we examine, we do the following calculations (example below):
STEP_A = row_missing_elements.intersection(column_missing_elements) = [elements in both row_missing_elements AND column_missing_elements]
STEP_B = STEP_A.intersection(block_missing_elements) = [elements in both STEP_A AND block_missing_elements]
common_missing_elements: [STEP_B]
FOUND: square(row, column) (print this line if there is Only one common_missing_element in that square, otherwise leave this line blank and keep going)

Example:
### first_row_unfilled_columns: second, seventh, eighth
#### 1 of {number_of_squares_to_list}
(first_row, second_column):
Using first_row_missing_elements, second_column_missing_elements, and top_left_block_missing_elements (do not list the elements here, just the set names)
STEP_A: [2,7,8].intersection([1,2,7]) = [2,7]
STEP_B: [2,7].intersection([2,9]) = [2]
common_missing_elements: [2]
FOUND: square(first_row, second_column) (If the square has one only one common_missing_element, also print "FOUND ONE: square(row, column)" like this, then keep going)

When we have done as many unfilled squares as specified by number_of_squares_to_list, we stop listing squares and print:
"Finished printing 17 out of 17 squares" (using appropriate numbers)

# Outputting the found squares
## Collating Results
For Every unfilled square that had ONLY one common element (marked with "FOUND: square(row, column)"), we list them below so they are all in one place.

FOUND: square(first_row, second_column)

Make sure to list ALL of them

If there where none, instead print "There were no unfilled squares with only one common_missing_element"


## Unbiased Results
Finally, for every square in the results, we need to list them in the following format:
square(first_row, second_column)
first_row_missing_elements = [2,7,8]
second_column_missing_elements = [1,2,7]
top_left_block_missing_elements = [2,7]

Note that neither of the output sections lists the common_missing_element found in that square. This is to allow unbiased verification of the results.

Make sure to list all of them

If there where none, instead print "There are no candidate squares"

prompt 7 of 7:
# Task and background
- My previous message contains the last few hundred characters of a Sudoku analysis.
- You are examining the results in the "Unbiased Results" section of the previous message. Ignore all text before that section.
- The cells given in the section "Unbiased Results" are cells which were found to have only one possible candidate.
- However, the process which found the given cells will sometimes make mistakes, due to having to check so many cells at once.
- Your task is to use the given instructions to perform an independent verification or rejection of the given cells.
- Detailed instructions are provided below, but an overview is as follows:
    - Calculate the possible candidate elements for each cell using the method given below.
    - If a cell has multiple candidates, or fails some other given condition, reject that cell as a mistake made by the previous process.
- Complete all steps starting at STEP_ONE.


# STEP_ONE Extracting Previous Results
- Extract the results of the "Unbiased Results" section in the previous message.
- If there is no section marked "Unbiased Results" in the previous message, that means the start of it was cut off. In that case just start with the first complete cell you can see.
- Only take at most the first FOUR cells of the "Unbiased Results" section, as that's all the system can handle.
- Print the text from that section under the current heading "STEP_ONE Extracting Previous Results". Do not print the heading from the previous message.
- Note: When you print the text, change '_missing_elements' to '_candidates' for the row, column, and block for every cell. Everything else should remain the same.
- These cells will be used in STEP_TWO.


# STEP_TWO Calculating the candidates of each cell
- For each cell from STEP_ONE, use the following method to calculate the candidates of that cell.
- For each cell:
    - Loop through the digits 1 to 9
    - For each digit, count the number of times that digit appears in the row_candidates list, the column_candidates list, and the block_candidates lists.
    - On the same line, sum the row count, the column count, and the block count to get the total_count.
    - Most importantly, if the total_count is 3, immediately print "FOUND A THREE".
- At the end of each cell, find all the digits which had a total_count of 3 (marked by FOUND A THREE) and list them as the candidates of that cell.
- Everytime you complete a cell print "Cell {current cell number} of {number of cells} complete! {number of cells left} more to go!"
- Then move to the next cell until all are done.
- If there are more than 4 cells, cap the number to check at 4.

- Here is an example with the correct format:
## Cell 1 of {number of cells}
cell(first_row, second_column):
row = first_row_candidates = [1,2,4,6]
column = second_column_candidates = [2,5,6,7,8,9]
block = top_left_block_candidates = [1,2,3,4,6,7]

row.count(1) = 1, column.count(1) = 0, block.count(1) = 1, total_count(1) = 2
row.count(2) = 1, column.count(2) = 1, block.count(2) = 1, total_count(2) = 3 FOUND A THREE
row.count(3) = 0, column.count(3) = 0, block.count(3) = 1, total_count(3) = 1
row.count(4) = 1, column.count(4) = 0, block.count(4) = 1, total_count(4) = 2
row.count(5) = 0, column.count(5) = 1, block.count(5) = 0, total_count(5) = 1
row.count(6) = 1, column.count(6) = 1, block.count(6) = 1, total_count(6) = 3 FOUND A THREE
row.count(7) = 0, column.count(7) = 1, block.count(7) = 1, total_count(7) = 2
row.count(8) = 0, column.count(8) = 1, block.count(8) = 0, total_count(8) = 1
row.count(9) = 0, column.count(9) = 1, block.count(9) = 0, total_count(9) = 1

Confirmed candidates found for cell(first_row, second_column): [2,6]
Cell 1 of 3 complete! 2 more to go!!!

- After you have done All of the cells, list them in one place.
- Example:
## Candidates of the cells
cell(first_row, second_column): [2,6]
cell(second_row, eighth_column): [9]
cell(fourth_row, second_column): [1]

- Make sure to list All the cells, up to a maximum of 4


# STEP_THREE Checking the number of elements in each cell
- For each cell, count the number of elements in the candidates of that cell using .length().
- After each length, either print "length is 1, Passes" if the length is 1, or print "length is {length}, not 1, Rejected" if the length is Not one.
- Example:
cell(first_row, second_column): [2,6]
[2,6].length = number from 2
length is 2, not 1, Rejected

- After doing this for all the cells, list the cells which Passed, making sure Not to list any Rejected cells.
- Example:
## Passing Cells
cell(second_row, eighth_column): [9]
cell(fourth_row, second_column): [1]


# STEP_FOUR: Grouping Cells with Corresponding Rows
- Group each cell from the "Passing Cells" in STEP_THREE with their corresponding row from the current Sudoku. Do not update them yet.
- If there are no passing cells to update, print "There are no cells to update" and move to the next step.
- The current Sudoku is the second message I sent. Since it's so far back print it here (in the exact format it appears but without the output tags) to avoid confusing it with the examples.

- Example:
Current Sudoku:
{Current Sudoku Goes Here}

first_row: [0,3,0,0,8,0,4,9,0]
cell(first_row, fourth_column): [5]

fourth_row: [0,4,1,6,7,3,2,5,8]
cell(fourth_row, first_column): [9]

seventh_row: [2,0,4,0,0,0,0,8,0]
cell(seventh_row, eighth_column): [3]


# STEP_FIVE: Applying Cell Updates to Rows
- Now that the cells to update are cleanly grouped with the appropriate rows, confirm the column position and update each appropriate row.
- However, and this is VITAL: If the column position does NOT have a zero, IMMEDIATELY reject that cell and move on to the next.

- Example:
first_row: [0,3,0,0,8,0,4,9,0]
cell(first_row, fourth_column): [5]
The 4th position of the first_row is 0, so we can proceed.
Updating the value in the 4th position of the first_row:
updated_first_row: [0,3,0,5,8,0,4,9,0]

fourth_row: [0,4,1,6,7,3,2,5,8]
cell(fourth_row, first_column): [9]
The 1st position of the fourth_row is 0, so we can proceed.
Updating the value in the 1st position of the fourth_row:
updated_fourth_row: [9,4,1,6,7,3,2,5,8]

seventh_row: [2,0,4,0,0,0,0,8,0]
cell(seventh_row, eighth_column): [3]
The 8th position of the seventh_row is 8, WHICH IS NOT 0. This cell is rejected and will not be updated.


# STEP_SIX: Printing the Updated Sudoku
- Now print the Sudoku using the updated rows
- Specify the rows to update first to be sure they aren't forgotten. Do not include any rejected cells.

- Example:
The rows to update are first and fourth
updated_first_row: [0,3,0,5,8,0,4,9,0]
second_row: [0,9,2,0,4,1,0,0,0]
third_row: [0,6,0,7,0,9,0,0,5]
updated_fourth_row: [9,4,1,6,7,3,2,5,8]
fifth_row: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3]
sixth_row: [7,8,0,0,5,2,6,0,0]
seventh_row: [2,0,4,0,0,0,0,8,0]
eighth_row: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,4]
ninth_row: [0,1,0,0,3,0,0,2,0]


# Standardizing Row Names in the Updated Sudoku
- Print the Sudoku you just updated, but with the the original NAMES for the rows.
- Make sure the elements are from the UPDATED Sudoku in STEP_SIX.
- As there is now an old and an updated Sudoku, both of which look similar, write the following above the updated Sudoku
"The rows to fix the NAMES of are {rows to change}. The elements are the same as in STEP_SIX."

- Example:
The rows to fix the NAMES of are first and fourth. The elements are the same as in STEP_SIX.

first_row: [0,3,0,5,8,0,4,9,0]
second_row: [0,9,2,0,4,1,0,0,0]
third_row: [0,6,0,7,0,9,0,0,5]
fourth_row: [9,4,1,6,7,3,2,5,8]
fifth_row: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3]
sixth_row: [7,8,0,0,5,2,6,0,0]
seventh_row: [2,0,4,0,0,0,0,8,0]
eighth_row: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,4]
ninth_row: [0,1,0,0,3,0,0,2,0]

- Do not modify any other names in the Sudoku.


# STEP_SEVEN: Shifting the Rows of the Sudoku
- Before you output the Sudoku, the top three rows need to shifted to the bottom, like cutting a deck of cards.
- The rows to be in the order: fourth, fifth, sixth, seventh, eighth, ninth, first, second, third.

- Example:
fourth_row: [9,4,1,6,7,3,2,5,8]
fifth_row: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3]
sixth_row: [7,8,0,0,5,2,6,0,0]
seventh_row: [2,0,4,0,0,0,0,8,0]
eighth_row: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,4]
ninth_row: [0,1,0,0,3,0,0,2,0]
first_row: [0,3,0,5,8,0,4,9,0]
second_row: [0,9,2,0,4,1,0,0,0]
third_row: [0,6,0,7,0,9,0,0,5]


# STEP_EIGHT Fixing the Row Names and Outputting the Sudoku
- WITHOUT moving the elements of the Sudoku, standardize the row names.
- Also surround the Sudoku in output tags to clearly mark it as the output.
- Do not write ANYTHING after the closing output tag, as it will interfere with the system extracting your output.

- Example:
<Output>
first_row: [9,4,1,6,7,3,2,5,8]
second_row: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3]
third_row: [7,8,0,0,5,2,6,0,0]
fourth_row: [2,0,4,0,0,0,0,8,0]
fifth_row: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,4]
sixth_row: [0,1,0,0,3,0,0,2,0]
seventh_row: [0,3,0,5,8,0,4,9,0]
eighth_row: [0,9,2,0,4,1,0,0,0]
ninth_row: [0,6,0,7,0,9,0,0,5]
</Output>


# Final notes
- Ensure all outputs are clearly labeled using the simple headers provided in the instructions.
- Do not use code blocks. Just plain text with the headers in the instructions is fine.
- Stop ONLY after completing STEP_EIGHT, writing NOTHING ELSE after you write the final closing output tag.
- Begin

You are going to analyze the sudoku you've just been given.
The analysis will come down to one thing, finding the candidate elements for each unfilled square.
To do this, examine the nine rows, the nine columns, and the nine blocks, and find the elements missing from each set.
Then, for each unfilled square (squares with a '0'), examine the elements missing from the row, column, and 3-by-3 block associated with that square, combine them into a set of common candidates, and check to see whether or not there is Exactly one candidate in that set. Everything else follows from that.



# Board State
Trying to play without vision is difficult, so I want you to follow a very specific format.
I want you to print out the current board state using the _exact_ format shown below (replace the example with the current sudoku).
We are also finding the missing elements of each set. So we are taking the current row, column, or block, and calculating the set-wise difference between that row, column, or block, and the digits 1-9 shown in all_digits.
Each block and its missing elements will (between them) exactly cover the digits from 1 to 9 with no duplicates, and with each number appearing exactly once.
## Rows
all_digits = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]

Print all nine rows and row_missing_elements using the format:
row: [row], row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([row]) = [row_missing_elements]

Examples:
first_row: [1,0,3,4,5,6,0,0,9], first_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([1,0,3,4,5,6,0,0,9]) = [2,7,8]
second_row: [4,5,6,7,8,9,1,2,3], second_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([4,5,6,7,8,9,1,2,3]) = []
third_row: [7,8,0,1,2,3,4,5,6], third_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([7,8,0,1,2,3,4,5,6]) = [9]
fourth_row: [2,3,4,5,6,7,8,0,1], fourth_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([2,3,4,5,6,7,8,0,1]) = [9]
fifth_row: [5,6,7,8,9,1,2,3,4], fifth_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([5,6,7,8,9,1,2,3,4]) = []
sixth_row: [8,9,1,2,0,4,5,6,7], sixth_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([8,9,1,2,0,4,5,6,7]) = [3]
seventh_row: [3,4,5,6,7,8,9,1,2], seventh_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([3,4,5,6,7,8,9,1,2]) = []
eighth_row: [6,0,8,9,1,2,3,0,5], eighth_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([6,0,8,9,1,2,3,0,5]) = [4,7]
ninth_row: [9,0,2,0,4,5,0,7,8], ninth_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([9,0,2,0,4,5,0,7,8]) = [1,3,6]


## Columns
all_digits = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]

Format:
column: [column], column_missing_elements: [all_digits].difference([column]) = [column_missing_elements]

Examples:
first_column: [1,4,7,2,5,8,3,6,9] first_column_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([1,4,7,2,5,8,3,6,9]) = []
second_column: [0,5,8,3,6,9,4,0,0] second_column_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([0,5,8,3,6,9,4,0,0]) = [1,2,7]
third_column: [3,6,0,4,7,1,5,8,2] third_column_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([3,6,0,4,7,1,5,8,2]) = [9]
fourth_column: 

## Blocks
all_digits = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]

Format:
block: (rows: rows in the block; columns: columns in the block):
[block]
block_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([block]) = [block_missing_elements]

Examples:
top_left_block: (rows: first_row, second_row, third_row; columns: first_column, second_column, third_column)
[[1,0,3],
[4,5,6],
[7,8,0]]
top_left_block_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([1,0,3,4,5,6,7,8,0]) = [2,9]

top_middle_block: (rows: first_row, second_row, third_row; columns: fourth_column, fifth_column, sixth_column)
[[4,5,6],
[7,8,9],
[1,2,3]]
top_middle_block_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([4,5,6,7,8,9,1,2,3]) = []

top_right_block: (rows: first_row, second_row, third_row; columns: seventh_column, eighth_column, ninth_column)
[[0,0,9],
[1,2,3],
[4,5,6]]
top_right_block_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([0,0,9,1,2,3,4,5,6]) = [7,8]

middle_left_block: (rows: fourth_row, fifth_row, sixth_row; columns: first_column, second_column, third_column)



# Finding and counting the zero elements
## The positions of the zeroes
For each row we do the following calculations:
row_unfilled_indices: [row].index(0) = [index of every '0' element in the row]
row_unfilled_positions: row_unfilled_indices.increment(1) = [each index incremented by 1]
row_unfilled_columns: the word versions of the positions of the zeroes

Use the following format:
first_row_unfilled_indices: [1,0,3,4,5,6,0,0,9].index(0) = [1,6,7]
first_row_unfilled_positions: first_row_unfilled_indices.increment(1) = [2,7,8]
first_row_unfilled_columns: second, seventh, eighth


## Calculate the number of unfilled squares
A simple one line calculation By Hand to get the total number of unfilled squares:
total_unfilled_squares = 3 + 0 + 1 + 1 + 0 + 1 + 0 + 2 + 3 = 11

Then we cap the number of squares to list:
number_of_squares_to_list = min(total_unfilled_squares, 17) = 11



# Candidate analysis
## Common candidates in each unfilled square
Go through each unfilled square and list the missing elements for the row, column, and block containing that square (use the row and column to get the correct block).
Calculate the elements that are in Both the row, AND the column. Make sure to find ALL of them.
Then calculate the elements that are in Both STEP_A (the previous result), AND the block. Make sure to find ALL of them.

Make sure to ONLY do unfilled squares, which we calculated in the section 'The positions of the zeroes'.
For each unfilled square we examine, we do the following calculations (example below):
STEP_A = row_missing_elements.intersection(column_missing_elements) = [elements in both row_missing_elements AND column_missing_elements]
STEP_B = STEP_A.intersection(block_missing_elements) = [elements in both STEP_A AND block_missing_elements]
common_missing_elements: [STEP_B]
FOUND: square(row, column) (print this line if there is Only one common_missing_element in that square, otherwise leave this line blank and keep going)

Example:
### first_row_unfilled_columns: second, seventh, eighth
#### 1 of {number_of_squares_to_list}
(first_row, second_column):
Using first_row_missing_elements, second_column_missing_elements, and top_left_block_missing_elements (do not list the elements here, just the set names)
STEP_A: [2,7,8].intersection([1,2,7]) = [2,7]
STEP_B: [2,7].intersection([2,9]) = [2]
common_missing_elements: [2]
FOUND: square(first_row, second_column) (If the square has one only one common_missing_element, also print "FOUND ONE: square(row, column)" like this, then keep going)

When we have done as many unfilled squares as specified by number_of_squares_to_list, we stop listing squares and print:
"Finished printing 17 out of 17 squares" (using appropriate numbers)

# Outputting the found squares
## Collating Results
For Every unfilled square that had ONLY one common element (marked with "FOUND: square(row, column)"), we list them below so they are all in one place.

FOUND: square(first_row, second_column)

Make sure to list ALL of them

If there where none, instead print "There were no unfilled squares with only one common_missing_element"


## Unbiased Results
Finally, for every square in the results, we need to list them in the following format:
square(first_row, second_column)
first_row_missing_elements = [2,7,8]
second_column_missing_elements = [1,2,7]
top_left_block_missing_elements = [2,7]

Note that neither of the output sections lists the common_missing_element found in that square. This is to allow unbiased verification of the results.

Make sure to list all of them

If there where none, instead print "There are no candidate squares"

system_message:
Follow ALL instructions METHODICALLY and IN FULL. Your task is to calculate the possible candidate elements for the given cells, then to update the non-rejected cells of the given sudoku using the calculated candidate elements, then to shift the rows, and finally to output the updated and shifted sudoku. Once you begin you must complete ALL of these tasks BEFORE stopping. After receiving the full instructions you have ONLY one message to finish the task, as soon as you stop responding the final section of your response is sent to the next part of the process. Thus the final text you write MUST be the updated and shifted Sudoku, in the correct format, after ALL other sections have been completed. Begin as soon as you receive the full instruction set.

prompt 1 of 7:
Respond to this message with "Awaiting instructions." and nothing else. When you receive the current sudoku in <output> tags, say only "Awaiting instructions." and nothing else. You will then receive the last few hundred characters of the previous analysis results. When you receive the previous results say "Awaiting instructions." and nothing else. You will then receive instructions. When you receive the instructions, you may begin.

prompt 7 of 7:
# Task and background
- My previous message contains the last few hundred characters of a Sudoku analysis.
- You are examining the results in the "Unbiased Results" section of the previous message. Ignore all text before that section.
- The cells given in the section "Unbiased Results" are cells which were found to have only one possible candidate.
- However, the process which found the given cells will sometimes make mistakes, due to having to check so many cells at once.
- Your task is to use the given instructions to perform an independent verification or rejection of the given cells.
- Detailed instructions are provided below, but an overview is as follows:
    - Calculate the possible candidate elements for each cell using the method given below.
    - If a cell has multiple candidates, or fails some other given condition, reject that cell as a mistake made by the previous process.
- Complete all steps starting at STEP_ONE.


# STEP_ONE Extracting Previous Results
- Extract the results of the "Unbiased Results" section in the previous message.
- If there is no section marked "Unbiased Results" in the previous message, that means the start of it was cut off. In that case just start with the first complete cell you can see.
- Only take at most the first FOUR cells of the "Unbiased Results" section, as that's all the system can handle.
- Print the text from that section under the current heading "STEP_ONE Extracting Previous Results". Do not print the heading from the previous message.
- Note: When you print the text, change '_missing_elements' to '_candidates' for the row, column, and block for every cell. Everything else should remain the same.
- These cells will be used in STEP_TWO.


# STEP_TWO Calculating the candidates of each cell
- For each cell from STEP_ONE, use the following method to calculate the candidates of that cell.
- For each cell:
    - Loop through the digits 1 to 9
    - For each digit, count the number of times that digit appears in the row_candidates list, the column_candidates list, and the block_candidates lists.
    - On the same line, sum the row count, the column count, and the block count to get the total_count.
    - Most importantly, if the total_count is 3, immediately print "FOUND A THREE".
- At the end of each cell, find all the digits which had a total_count of 3 (marked by FOUND A THREE) and list them as the candidates of that cell.
- Everytime you complete a cell print "Cell {current cell number} of {number of cells} complete! {number of cells left} more to go!"
- Then move to the next cell until all are done.
- If there are more than 4 cells, cap the number to check at 4.

- Here is an example with the correct format:
## Cell 1 of {number of cells}
cell(first_row, second_column):
row = first_row_candidates = [1,2,4,6]
column = second_column_candidates = [2,5,6,7,8,9]
block = top_left_block_candidates = [1,2,3,4,6,7]

row.count(1) = 1, column.count(1) = 0, block.count(1) = 1, total_count(1) = 2
row.count(2) = 1, column.count(2) = 1, block.count(2) = 1, total_count(2) = 3 FOUND A THREE
row.count(3) = 0, column.count(3) = 0, block.count(3) = 1, total_count(3) = 1
row.count(4) = 1, column.count(4) = 0, block.count(4) = 1, total_count(4) = 2
row.count(5) = 0, column.count(5) = 1, block.count(5) = 0, total_count(5) = 1
row.count(6) = 1, column.count(6) = 1, block.count(6) = 1, total_count(6) = 3 FOUND A THREE
row.count(7) = 0, column.count(7) = 1, block.count(7) = 1, total_count(7) = 2
row.count(8) = 0, column.count(8) = 1, block.count(8) = 0, total_count(8) = 1
row.count(9) = 0, column.count(9) = 1, block.count(9) = 0, total_count(9) = 1

Confirmed candidates found for cell(first_row, second_column): [2,6]
Cell 1 of 3 complete! 2 more to go!!!

- After you have done All of the cells, list them in one place.
- Example:
## Candidates of the cells
cell(first_row, second_column): [2,6]
cell(second_row, eighth_column): [9]
cell(fourth_row, second_column): [1]

- Make sure to list All the cells, up to a maximum of 4


# STEP_THREE Checking the number of elements in each cell
- For each cell, count the number of elements in the candidates of that cell using .length().
- After each length, either print "length is 1, Passes" if the length is 1, or print "length is {length}, not 1, Rejected" if the length is Not one.
- Example:
cell(first_row, second_column): [2,6]
[2,6].length = number from 2
length is 2, not 1, Rejected

- After doing this for all the cells, list the cells which Passed, making sure Not to list any Rejected cells.
- Example:
## Passing Cells
cell(second_row, eighth_column): [9]
cell(fourth_row, second_column): [1]


# STEP_FOUR: Grouping Cells with Corresponding Rows
- Group each cell from the "Passing Cells" in STEP_THREE with their corresponding row from the current Sudoku. Do not update them yet.
- If there are no passing cells to update, print "There are no cells to update" and move to the next step.
- The current Sudoku is the second message I sent. Since it's so far back print it here (in the exact format it appears but without the output tags) to avoid confusing it with the examples.

- Example:
Current Sudoku:
{Current Sudoku Goes Here}

first_row: [0,3,0,0,8,0,4,9,0]
cell(first_row, fourth_column): [5]

fourth_row: [0,4,1,6,7,3,2,5,8]
cell(fourth_row, first_column): [9]

seventh_row: [2,0,4,0,0,0,0,8,0]
cell(seventh_row, eighth_column): [3]


# STEP_FIVE: Applying Cell Updates to Rows
- Now that the cells to update are cleanly grouped with the appropriate rows, confirm the column position and update each appropriate row.
- However, and this is VITAL: If the column position does NOT have a zero, IMMEDIATELY reject that cell and move on to the next.

- Example:
first_row: [0,3,0,0,8,0,4,9,0]
cell(first_row, fourth_column): [5]
The 4th position of the first_row is 0, so we can proceed.
Updating the value in the 4th position of the first_row:
updated_first_row: [0,3,0,5,8,0,4,9,0]

fourth_row: [0,4,1,6,7,3,2,5,8]
cell(fourth_row, first_column): [9]
The 1st position of the fourth_row is 0, so we can proceed.
Updating the value in the 1st position of the fourth_row:
updated_fourth_row: [9,4,1,6,7,3,2,5,8]

seventh_row: [2,0,4,0,0,0,0,8,0]
cell(seventh_row, eighth_column): [3]
The 8th position of the seventh_row is 8, WHICH IS NOT 0. This cell is rejected and will not be updated.


# STEP_SIX: Printing the Updated Sudoku
- Now print the Sudoku using the updated rows
- Specify the rows to update first to be sure they aren't forgotten. Do not include any rejected cells.

- Example:
The rows to update are first and fourth
updated_first_row: [0,3,0,5,8,0,4,9,0]
second_row: [0,9,2,0,4,1,0,0,0]
third_row: [0,6,0,7,0,9,0,0,5]
updated_fourth_row: [9,4,1,6,7,3,2,5,8]
fifth_row: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3]
sixth_row: [7,8,0,0,5,2,6,0,0]
seventh_row: [2,0,4,0,0,0,0,8,0]
eighth_row: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,4]
ninth_row: [0,1,0,0,3,0,0,2,0]


# Standardizing Row Names in the Updated Sudoku
- Print the Sudoku you just updated, but with the the original NAMES for the rows.
- Make sure the elements are from the UPDATED Sudoku in STEP_SIX.
- As there is now an old and an updated Sudoku, both of which look similar, write the following above the updated Sudoku
"The rows to fix the NAMES of are {rows to change}. The elements are the same as in STEP_SIX."

- Example:
The rows to fix the NAMES of are first and fourth. The elements are the same as in STEP_SIX.

first_row: [0,3,0,5,8,0,4,9,0]
second_row: [0,9,2,0,4,1,0,0,0]
third_row: [0,6,0,7,0,9,0,0,5]
fourth_row: [9,4,1,6,7,3,2,5,8]
fifth_row: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3]
sixth_row: [7,8,0,0,5,2,6,0,0]
seventh_row: [2,0,4,0,0,0,0,8,0]
eighth_row: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,4]
ninth_row: [0,1,0,0,3,0,0,2,0]

- Do not modify any other names in the Sudoku.


# STEP_SEVEN: Shifting the Rows of the Sudoku
- Before you output the Sudoku, the top three rows need to shifted to the bottom, like cutting a deck of cards.
- The rows to be in the order: fourth, fifth, sixth, seventh, eighth, ninth, first, second, third.

- Example:
fourth_row: [9,4,1,6,7,3,2,5,8]
fifth_row: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3]
sixth_row: [7,8,0,0,5,2,6,0,0]
seventh_row: [2,0,4,0,0,0,0,8,0]
eighth_row: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,4]
ninth_row: [0,1,0,0,3,0,0,2,0]
first_row: [0,3,0,5,8,0,4,9,0]
second_row: [0,9,2,0,4,1,0,0,0]
third_row: [0,6,0,7,0,9,0,0,5]


# STEP_EIGHT Fixing the Row Names and Outputting the Sudoku
- WITHOUT moving the elements of the Sudoku, standardize the row names.
- Also surround the Sudoku in output tags to clearly mark it as the output.
- Do not write ANYTHING after the closing output tag, as it will interfere with the system extracting your output.

- Example:
<Output>
first_row: [9,4,1,6,7,3,2,5,8]
second_row: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3]
third_row: [7,8,0,0,5,2,6,0,0]
fourth_row: [2,0,4,0,0,0,0,8,0]
fifth_row: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,4]
sixth_row: [0,1,0,0,3,0,0,2,0]
seventh_row: [0,3,0,5,8,0,4,9,0]
eighth_row: [0,9,2,0,4,1,0,0,0]
ninth_row: [0,6,0,7,0,9,0,0,5]
</Output>


# Final notes
- Ensure all outputs are clearly labeled using the simple headers provided in the instructions.
- Do not use code blocks. Just plain text with the headers in the instructions is fine.
- Stop ONLY after completing STEP_EIGHT, writing NOTHING ELSE after you write the final closing output tag.
- Begin

prompt 3 of 3:
You are going to analyze the sudoku you've just been given.
The analysis will come down to one thing, finding the candidate elements for each unfilled square.
To do this, examine the nine rows, the nine columns, and the nine blocks, and find the elements missing from each set.
Then, for each unfilled square (squares with a '0'), examine the elements missing from the row, column, and 3-by-3 block associated with that square, combine them into a set of common candidates, and check to see whether or not there is Exactly one candidate in that set. Everything else follows from that.



# Board State
Trying to play without vision is difficult, so I want you to follow a very specific format.
I want you to print out the current board state using the _exact_ format shown below (replace the example with the current sudoku).
We are also finding the missing elements of each set. So we are taking the current row, column, or block, and calculating the set-wise difference between that row, column, or block, and the digits 1-9 shown in all_digits.
Each block and its missing elements will (between them) exactly cover the digits from 1 to 9 with no duplicates, and with each number appearing exactly once.
## Rows
all_digits = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]

Print all nine rows and row_missing_elements using the format:
row: [row], row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([row]) = [row_missing_elements]

Examples:
first_row: [1,0,3,4,5,6,0,0,9], first_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([1,0,3,4,5,6,0,0,9]) = [2,7,8]
second_row: [4,5,6,7,8,9,1,2,3], second_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([4,5,6,7,8,9,1,2,3]) = []
third_row: [7,8,0,1,2,3,4,5,6], third_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([7,8,0,1,2,3,4,5,6]) = [9]
fourth_row: [2,3,4,5,6,7,8,0,1], fourth_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([2,3,4,5,6,7,8,0,1]) = [9]
fifth_row: [5,6,7,8,9,1,2,3,4], fifth_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([5,6,7,8,9,1,2,3,4]) = []
sixth_row: [8,9,1,2,0,4,5,6,7], sixth_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([8,9,1,2,0,4,5,6,7]) = [3]
seventh_row: [3,4,5,6,7,8,9,1,2], seventh_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([3,4,5,6,7,8,9,1,2]) = []
eighth_row: [6,0,8,9,1,2,3,0,5], eighth_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([6,0,8,9,1,2,3,0,5]) = [4,7]
ninth_row: [9,0,2,0,4,5,0,7,8], ninth_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([9,0,2,0,4,5,0,7,8]) = [1,3,6]


## Columns
all_digits = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]

Format:
column: [column], column_missing_elements: [all_digits].difference([column]) = [column_missing_elements]

Examples:
first_column: [1,4,7,2,5,8,3,6,9] first_column_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([1,4,7,2,5,8,3,6,9]) = []
second_column: [0,5,8,3,6,9,4,0,0] second_column_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([0,5,8,3,6,9,4,0,0]) = [1,2,7]
third_column: [3,6,0,4,7,1,5,8,2] third_column_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([3,6,0,4,7,1,5,8,2]) = [9]
fourth_column: 

## Blocks
all_digits = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]

Format:
block: (rows: rows in the block; columns: columns in the block):
[block]
block_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([block]) = [block_missing_elements]

Examples:
top_left_block: (rows: first_row, second_row, third_row; columns: first_column, second_column, third_column)
[[1,0,3],
[4,5,6],
[7,8,0]]
top_left_block_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([1,0,3,4,5,6,7,8,0]) = [2,9]

top_middle_block: (rows: first_row, second_row, third_row; columns: fourth_column, fifth_column, sixth_column)
[[4,5,6],
[7,8,9],
[1,2,3]]
top_middle_block_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([4,5,6,7,8,9,1,2,3]) = []

top_right_block: (rows: first_row, second_row, third_row; columns: seventh_column, eighth_column, ninth_column)
[[0,0,9],
[1,2,3],
[4,5,6]]
top_right_block_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([0,0,9,1,2,3,4,5,6]) = [7,8]

middle_left_block: (rows: fourth_row, fifth_row, sixth_row; columns: first_column, second_column, third_column)



# Finding and counting the zero elements
## The positions of the zeroes
For each row we do the following calculations:
row_unfilled_indices: [row].index(0) = [index of every '0' element in the row]
row_unfilled_positions: row_unfilled_indices.increment(1) = [each index incremented by 1]
row_unfilled_columns: the word versions of the positions of the zeroes

Use the following format:
first_row_unfilled_indices: [1,0,3,4,5,6,0,0,9].index(0) = [1,6,7]
first_row_unfilled_positions: first_row_unfilled_indices.increment(1) = [2,7,8]
first_row_unfilled_columns: second, seventh, eighth


## Calculate the number of unfilled squares
A simple one line calculation By Hand to get the total number of unfilled squares:
total_unfilled_squares = 3 + 0 + 1 + 1 + 0 + 1 + 0 + 2 + 3 = 11

Then we cap the number of squares to list:
number_of_squares_to_list = min(total_unfilled_squares, 17) = 11



# Candidate analysis
## Common candidates in each unfilled square
Go through each unfilled square and list the missing elements for the row, column, and block containing that square (use the row and column to get the correct block).
Calculate the elements that are in Both the row, AND the column. Make sure to find ALL of them.
Then calculate the elements that are in Both STEP_A (the previous result), AND the block. Make sure to find ALL of them.

Make sure to ONLY do unfilled squares, which we calculated in the section 'The positions of the zeroes'.
For each unfilled square we examine, we do the following calculations (example below):
STEP_A = row_missing_elements.intersection(column_missing_elements) = [elements in both row_missing_elements AND column_missing_elements]
STEP_B = STEP_A.intersection(block_missing_elements) = [elements in both STEP_A AND block_missing_elements]
common_missing_elements: [STEP_B]
FOUND: square(row, column) (print this line if there is Only one common_missing_element in that square, otherwise leave this line blank and keep going)

Example:
### first_row_unfilled_columns: second, seventh, eighth
#### 1 of {number_of_squares_to_list}
(first_row, second_column):
Using first_row_missing_elements, second_column_missing_elements, and top_left_block_missing_elements (do not list the elements here, just the set names)
STEP_A: [2,7,8].intersection([1,2,7]) = [2,7]
STEP_B: [2,7].intersection([2,9]) = [2]
common_missing_elements: [2]
FOUND: square(first_row, second_column) (If the square has one only one common_missing_element, also print "FOUND ONE: square(row, column)" like this, then keep going)

When we have done as many unfilled squares as specified by number_of_squares_to_list, we stop listing squares and print:
"Finished printing 17 out of 17 squares" (using appropriate numbers)

# Outputting the found squares
## Collating Results
For Every unfilled square that had ONLY one common element (marked with "FOUND: square(row, column)"), we list them below so they are all in one place.

FOUND: square(first_row, second_column)

Make sure to list ALL of them

If there where none, instead print "There were no unfilled squares with only one common_missing_element"


## Unbiased Results
Finally, for every square in the results, we need to list them in the following format:
square(first_row, second_column)
first_row_missing_elements = [2,7,8]
second_column_missing_elements = [1,2,7]
top_left_block_missing_elements = [2,7]

Note that neither of the output sections lists the common_missing_element found in that square. This is to allow unbiased verification of the results.

Make sure to list all of them

If there where none, instead print "There are no candidate squares"

Follow ALL instructions METHODICALLY and IN FULL. Your task is to calculate the possible candidate elements for the given cells, then to update the non-rejected cells of the given sudoku using the calculated candidate elements, then to shift the rows, and finally to output the updated and shifted sudoku. Once you begin you must complete ALL of these tasks BEFORE stopping. After receiving the full instructions you have ONLY one message to finish the task, as soon as you stop responding the final section of your response is sent to the next part of the process. Thus the final text you write MUST be the updated and shifted Sudoku, in the correct format, after ALL other sections have been completed. Begin as soon as you receive the full instruction set.

prompt 1 of 7:
Respond to this message with "Awaiting instructions." and nothing else. When you receive the current sudoku in <output> tags, say only "Awaiting instructions." and nothing else. You will then receive the last few hundred characters of the previous analysis results. When you receive the previous results say "Awaiting instructions." and nothing else. You will then receive instructions. When you receive the instructions, you may begin.

prompt 7 of 7:
# Task and background
- My previous message contains the last few hundred characters of a Sudoku analysis.
- You are examining the results in the "Unbiased Results" section of the previous message. Ignore all text before that section.
- The cells given in the section "Unbiased Results" are cells which were found to have only one possible candidate.
- However, the process which found the given cells will sometimes make mistakes, due to having to check so many cells at once.
- Your task is to use the given instructions to perform an independent verification or rejection of the given cells.
- Detailed instructions are provided below, but an overview is as follows:
    - Calculate the possible candidate elements for each cell using the method given below.
    - If a cell has multiple candidates, or fails some other given condition, reject that cell as a mistake made by the previous process.
- Complete all steps starting at STEP_ONE.


# STEP_ONE Extracting Previous Results
- Extract the results of the "Unbiased Results" section in the previous message.
- If there is no section marked "Unbiased Results" in the previous message, that means the start of it was cut off. In that case just start with the first complete cell you can see.
- Only take at most the first FOUR cells of the "Unbiased Results" section, as that's all the system can handle.
- Print the text from that section under the current heading "STEP_ONE Extracting Previous Results". Do not print the heading from the previous message.
- Note: When you print the text, change '_missing_elements' to '_candidates' for the row, column, and block for every cell. Everything else should remain the same.
- These cells will be used in STEP_TWO.


# STEP_TWO Calculating the candidates of each cell
- For each cell from STEP_ONE, use the following method to calculate the candidates of that cell.
- For each cell:
    - Loop through the digits 1 to 9
    - For each digit, count the number of times that digit appears in the row_candidates list, the column_candidates list, and the block_candidates lists.
    - On the same line, sum the row count, the column count, and the block count to get the total_count.
    - Most importantly, if the total_count is 3, immediately print "FOUND A THREE".
- At the end of each cell, find all the digits which had a total_count of 3 (marked by FOUND A THREE) and list them as the candidates of that cell.
- Everytime you complete a cell print "Cell {current cell number} of {number of cells} complete! {number of cells left} more to go!"
- Then move to the next cell until all are done.
- If there are more than 4 cells, cap the number to check at 4.

- Here is an example with the correct format:
## Cell 1 of {number of cells}
cell(first_row, second_column):
row = first_row_candidates = [1,2,4,6]
column = second_column_candidates = [2,5,6,7,8,9]
block = top_left_block_candidates = [1,2,3,4,6,7]

row.count(1) = 1, column.count(1) = 0, block.count(1) = 1, total_count(1) = 2
row.count(2) = 1, column.count(2) = 1, block.count(2) = 1, total_count(2) = 3 FOUND A THREE
row.count(3) = 0, column.count(3) = 0, block.count(3) = 1, total_count(3) = 1
row.count(4) = 1, column.count(4) = 0, block.count(4) = 1, total_count(4) = 2
row.count(5) = 0, column.count(5) = 1, block.count(5) = 0, total_count(5) = 1
row.count(6) = 1, column.count(6) = 1, block.count(6) = 1, total_count(6) = 3 FOUND A THREE
row.count(7) = 0, column.count(7) = 1, block.count(7) = 1, total_count(7) = 2
row.count(8) = 0, column.count(8) = 1, block.count(8) = 0, total_count(8) = 1
row.count(9) = 0, column.count(9) = 1, block.count(9) = 0, total_count(9) = 1

Confirmed candidates found for cell(first_row, second_column): [2,6]
Cell 1 of 3 complete! 2 more to go!!!

- After you have done All of the cells, list them in one place.
- Example:
## Candidates of the cells
cell(first_row, second_column): [2,6]
cell(second_row, eighth_column): [9]
cell(fourth_row, second_column): [1]

- Make sure to list All the cells, up to a maximum of 4


# STEP_THREE Checking the number of elements in each cell
- For each cell, count the number of elements in the candidates of that cell using .length().
- After each length, either print "length is 1, Passes" if the length is 1, or print "length is {length}, not 1, Rejected" if the length is Not one.
- Example:
cell(first_row, second_column): [2,6]
[2,6].length = number from 2
length is 2, not 1, Rejected

- After doing this for all the cells, list the cells which Passed, making sure Not to list any Rejected cells.
- Example:
## Passing Cells
cell(second_row, eighth_column): [9]
cell(fourth_row, second_column): [1]


# STEP_FOUR: Grouping Cells with Corresponding Rows
- Group each cell from the "Passing Cells" in STEP_THREE with their corresponding row from the current Sudoku. Do not update them yet.
- If there are no passing cells to update, print "There are no cells to update" and move to the next step.
- The current Sudoku is the second message I sent. Since it's so far back print it here (in the exact format it appears but without the output tags) to avoid confusing it with the examples.

- Example:
Current Sudoku:
{Current Sudoku Goes Here}

first_row: [0,3,0,0,8,0,4,9,0]
cell(first_row, fourth_column): [5]

fourth_row: [0,4,1,6,7,3,2,5,8]
cell(fourth_row, first_column): [9]

seventh_row: [2,0,4,0,0,0,0,8,0]
cell(seventh_row, eighth_column): [3]


# STEP_FIVE: Applying Cell Updates to Rows
- Now that the cells to update are cleanly grouped with the appropriate rows, confirm the column position and update each appropriate row.
- However, and this is VITAL: If the column position does NOT have a zero, IMMEDIATELY reject that cell and move on to the next.

- Example:
first_row: [0,3,0,0,8,0,4,9,0]
cell(first_row, fourth_column): [5]
The 4th position of the first_row is 0, so we can proceed.
Updating the value in the 4th position of the first_row:
updated_first_row: [0,3,0,5,8,0,4,9,0]

fourth_row: [0,4,1,6,7,3,2,5,8]
cell(fourth_row, first_column): [9]
The 1st position of the fourth_row is 0, so we can proceed.
Updating the value in the 1st position of the fourth_row:
updated_fourth_row: [9,4,1,6,7,3,2,5,8]

seventh_row: [2,0,4,0,0,0,0,8,0]
cell(seventh_row, eighth_column): [3]
The 8th position of the seventh_row is 8, WHICH IS NOT 0. This cell is rejected and will not be updated.


# STEP_SIX: Printing the Updated Sudoku
- Now print the Sudoku using the updated rows
- Specify the rows to update first to be sure they aren't forgotten. Do not include any rejected cells.

- Example:
The rows to update are first and fourth
updated_first_row: [0,3,0,5,8,0,4,9,0]
second_row: [0,9,2,0,4,1,0,0,0]
third_row: [0,6,0,7,0,9,0,0,5]
updated_fourth_row: [9,4,1,6,7,3,2,5,8]
fifth_row: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3]
sixth_row: [7,8,0,0,5,2,6,0,0]
seventh_row: [2,0,4,0,0,0,0,8,0]
eighth_row: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,4]
ninth_row: [0,1,0,0,3,0,0,2,0]


# Standardizing Row Names in the Updated Sudoku
- Print the Sudoku you just updated, but with the the original NAMES for the rows.
- Make sure the elements are from the UPDATED Sudoku in STEP_SIX.
- As there is now an old and an updated Sudoku, both of which look similar, write the following above the updated Sudoku
"The rows to fix the NAMES of are {rows to change}. The elements are the same as in STEP_SIX."

- Example:
The rows to fix the NAMES of are first and fourth. The elements are the same as in STEP_SIX.

first_row: [0,3,0,5,8,0,4,9,0]
second_row: [0,9,2,0,4,1,0,0,0]
third_row: [0,6,0,7,0,9,0,0,5]
fourth_row: [9,4,1,6,7,3,2,5,8]
fifth_row: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3]
sixth_row: [7,8,0,0,5,2,6,0,0]
seventh_row: [2,0,4,0,0,0,0,8,0]
eighth_row: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,4]
ninth_row: [0,1,0,0,3,0,0,2,0]

- Do not modify any other names in the Sudoku.


# STEP_SEVEN: Shifting the Rows of the Sudoku
- Before you output the Sudoku, the top three rows need to shifted to the bottom, like cutting a deck of cards.
- The rows to be in the order: fourth, fifth, sixth, seventh, eighth, ninth, first, second, third.

- Example:
fourth_row: [9,4,1,6,7,3,2,5,8]
fifth_row: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3]
sixth_row: [7,8,0,0,5,2,6,0,0]
seventh_row: [2,0,4,0,0,0,0,8,0]
eighth_row: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,4]
ninth_row: [0,1,0,0,3,0,0,2,0]
first_row: [0,3,0,5,8,0,4,9,0]
second_row: [0,9,2,0,4,1,0,0,0]
third_row: [0,6,0,7,0,9,0,0,5]


# STEP_EIGHT Fixing the Row Names and Outputting the Sudoku
- WITHOUT moving the elements of the Sudoku, standardize the row names.
- Also surround the Sudoku in output tags to clearly mark it as the output.
- Do not write ANYTHING after the closing output tag, as it will interfere with the system extracting your output.

- Example:
<Output>
first_row: [9,4,1,6,7,3,2,5,8]
second_row: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3]
third_row: [7,8,0,0,5,2,6,0,0]
fourth_row: [2,0,4,0,0,0,0,8,0]
fifth_row: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,4]
sixth_row: [0,1,0,0,3,0,0,2,0]
seventh_row: [0,3,0,5,8,0,4,9,0]
eighth_row: [0,9,2,0,4,1,0,0,0]
ninth_row: [0,6,0,7,0,9,0,0,5]
</Output>


# Final notes
- Ensure all outputs are clearly labeled using the simple headers provided in the instructions.
- Do not use code blocks. Just plain text with the headers in the instructions is fine.
- Stop ONLY after completing STEP_EIGHT, writing NOTHING ELSE after you write the final closing output tag.
- Begin

prompt 3 of 3:
You are going to analyze the sudoku you've just been given.
The analysis will come down to one thing, finding the candidate elements for each unfilled square.
To do this, examine the nine rows, the nine columns, and the nine blocks, and find the elements missing from each set.
Then, for each unfilled square (squares with a '0'), examine the elements missing from the row, column, and 3-by-3 block associated with that square, combine them into a set of common candidates, and check to see whether or not there is Exactly one candidate in that set. Everything else follows from that.



# Board State
Trying to play without vision is difficult, so I want you to follow a very specific format.
I want you to print out the current board state using the _exact_ format shown below (replace the example with the current sudoku).
We are also finding the missing elements of each set. So we are taking the current row, column, or block, and calculating the set-wise difference between that row, column, or block, and the digits 1-9 shown in all_digits.
Each block and its missing elements will (between them) exactly cover the digits from 1 to 9 with no duplicates, and with each number appearing exactly once.
## Rows
all_digits = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]

Print all nine rows and row_missing_elements using the format:
row: [row], row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([row]) = [row_missing_elements]

Examples:
first_row: [1,0,3,4,5,6,0,0,9], first_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([1,0,3,4,5,6,0,0,9]) = [2,7,8]
second_row: [4,5,6,7,8,9,1,2,3], second_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([4,5,6,7,8,9,1,2,3]) = []
third_row: [7,8,0,1,2,3,4,5,6], third_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([7,8,0,1,2,3,4,5,6]) = [9]
fourth_row: [2,3,4,5,6,7,8,0,1], fourth_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([2,3,4,5,6,7,8,0,1]) = [9]
fifth_row: [5,6,7,8,9,1,2,3,4], fifth_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([5,6,7,8,9,1,2,3,4]) = []
sixth_row: [8,9,1,2,0,4,5,6,7], sixth_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([8,9,1,2,0,4,5,6,7]) = [3]
seventh_row: [3,4,5,6,7,8,9,1,2], seventh_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([3,4,5,6,7,8,9,1,2]) = []
eighth_row: [6,0,8,9,1,2,3,0,5], eighth_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([6,0,8,9,1,2,3,0,5]) = [4,7]
ninth_row: [9,0,2,0,4,5,0,7,8], ninth_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([9,0,2,0,4,5,0,7,8]) = [1,3,6]


## Columns
all_digits = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]

Format:
column: [column], column_missing_elements: [all_digits].difference([column]) = [column_missing_elements]

Examples:
first_column: [1,4,7,2,5,8,3,6,9] first_column_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([1,4,7,2,5,8,3,6,9]) = []
second_column: [0,5,8,3,6,9,4,0,0] second_column_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([0,5,8,3,6,9,4,0,0]) = [1,2,7]
third_column: [3,6,0,4,7,1,5,8,2] third_column_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([3,6,0,4,7,1,5,8,2]) = [9]
fourth_column: 

## Blocks
all_digits = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]

Format:
block: (rows: rows in the block; columns: columns in the block):
[block]
block_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([block]) = [block_missing_elements]

Examples:
top_left_block: (rows: first_row, second_row, third_row; columns: first_column, second_column, third_column)
[[1,0,3],
[4,5,6],
[7,8,0]]
top_left_block_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([1,0,3,4,5,6,7,8,0]) = [2,9]

top_middle_block: (rows: first_row, second_row, third_row; columns: fourth_column, fifth_column, sixth_column)
[[4,5,6],
[7,8,9],
[1,2,3]]
top_middle_block_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([4,5,6,7,8,9,1,2,3]) = []

top_right_block: (rows: first_row, second_row, third_row; columns: seventh_column, eighth_column, ninth_column)
[[0,0,9],
[1,2,3],
[4,5,6]]
top_right_block_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([0,0,9,1,2,3,4,5,6]) = [7,8]

middle_left_block: (rows: fourth_row, fifth_row, sixth_row; columns: first_column, second_column, third_column)



# Finding and counting the zero elements
## The positions of the zeroes
For each row we do the following calculations:
row_unfilled_indices: [row].index(0) = [index of every '0' element in the row]
row_unfilled_positions: row_unfilled_indices.increment(1) = [each index incremented by 1]
row_unfilled_columns: the word versions of the positions of the zeroes

Use the following format:
first_row_unfilled_indices: [1,0,3,4,5,6,0,0,9].index(0) = [1,6,7]
first_row_unfilled_positions: first_row_unfilled_indices.increment(1) = [2,7,8]
first_row_unfilled_columns: second, seventh, eighth


## Calculate the number of unfilled squares
A simple one line calculation By Hand to get the total number of unfilled squares:
total_unfilled_squares = 3 + 0 + 1 + 1 + 0 + 1 + 0 + 2 + 3 = 11

Then we cap the number of squares to list:
number_of_squares_to_list = min(total_unfilled_squares, 17) = 11



# Candidate analysis
## Common candidates in each unfilled square
Go through each unfilled square and list the missing elements for the row, column, and block containing that square (use the row and column to get the correct block).
Calculate the elements that are in Both the row, AND the column. Make sure to find ALL of them.
Then calculate the elements that are in Both STEP_A (the previous result), AND the block. Make sure to find ALL of them.

Make sure to ONLY do unfilled squares, which we calculated in the section 'The positions of the zeroes'.
For each unfilled square we examine, we do the following calculations (example below):
STEP_A = row_missing_elements.intersection(column_missing_elements) = [elements in both row_missing_elements AND column_missing_elements]
STEP_B = STEP_A.intersection(block_missing_elements) = [elements in both STEP_A AND block_missing_elements]
common_missing_elements: [STEP_B]
FOUND: square(row, column) (print this line if there is Only one common_missing_element in that square, otherwise leave this line blank and keep going)

Example:
### first_row_unfilled_columns: second, seventh, eighth
#### 1 of {number_of_squares_to_list}
(first_row, second_column):
Using first_row_missing_elements, second_column_missing_elements, and top_left_block_missing_elements (do not list the elements here, just the set names)
STEP_A: [2,7,8].intersection([1,2,7]) = [2,7]
STEP_B: [2,7].intersection([2,9]) = [2]
common_missing_elements: [2]
FOUND: square(first_row, second_column) (If the square has one only one common_missing_element, also print "FOUND ONE: square(row, column)" like this, then keep going)

When we have done as many unfilled squares as specified by number_of_squares_to_list, we stop listing squares and print:
"Finished printing 17 out of 17 squares" (using appropriate numbers)

# Outputting the found squares
## Collating Results
For Every unfilled square that had ONLY one common element (marked with "FOUND: square(row, column)"), we list them below so they are all in one place.

FOUND: square(first_row, second_column)

Make sure to list ALL of them

If there where none, instead print "There were no unfilled squares with only one common_missing_element"


## Unbiased Results
Finally, for every square in the results, we need to list them in the following format:
square(first_row, second_column)
first_row_missing_elements = [2,7,8]
second_column_missing_elements = [1,2,7]
top_left_block_missing_elements = [2,7]

Note that neither of the output sections lists the common_missing_element found in that square. This is to allow unbiased verification of the results.

Make sure to list all of them

If there where none, instead print "There are no candidate squares"

Follow ALL instructions METHODICALLY and IN FULL. Your task is to calculate the possible candidate elements for the given cells, then to update the non-rejected cells of the given sudoku using the calculated candidate elements, then to shift the rows, and finally to output the updated and shifted sudoku. Once you begin you must complete ALL of these tasks BEFORE stopping. After receiving the full instructions you have ONLY one message to finish the task, as soon as you stop responding the final section of your response is sent to the next part of the process. Thus the final text you write MUST be the updated and shifted Sudoku, in the correct format, after ALL other sections have been completed. Begin as soon as you receive the full instruction set.

Respond to this message with "Awaiting instructions." and nothing else. When you receive the current sudoku in <output> tags, say only "Awaiting instructions." and nothing else. You will then receive the last few hundred characters of the previous analysis results. When you receive the previous results say "Awaiting instructions." and nothing else. You will then receive instructions. When you receive the instructions, you may begin.

prompt 7 of 7:
# Task and background
- My previous message contains the last few hundred characters of a Sudoku analysis.
- You are examining the results in the "Unbiased Results" section of the previous message. Ignore all text before that section.
- The cells given in the section "Unbiased Results" are cells which were found to have only one possible candidate.
- However, the process which found the given cells will sometimes make mistakes, due to having to check so many cells at once.
- Your task is to use the given instructions to perform an independent verification or rejection of the given cells.
- Detailed instructions are provided below, but an overview is as follows:
    - Calculate the possible candidate elements for each cell using the method given below.
    - If a cell has multiple candidates, or fails some other given condition, reject that cell as a mistake made by the previous process.
- Complete all steps starting at STEP_ONE.


# STEP_ONE Extracting Previous Results
- Extract the results of the "Unbiased Results" section in the previous message.
- If there is no section marked "Unbiased Results" in the previous message, that means the start of it was cut off. In that case just start with the first complete cell you can see.
- Only take at most the first FOUR cells of the "Unbiased Results" section, as that's all the system can handle.
- Print the text from that section under the current heading "STEP_ONE Extracting Previous Results". Do not print the heading from the previous message.
- Note: When you print the text, change '_missing_elements' to '_candidates' for the row, column, and block for every cell. Everything else should remain the same.
- These cells will be used in STEP_TWO.


# STEP_TWO Calculating the candidates of each cell
- For each cell from STEP_ONE, use the following method to calculate the candidates of that cell.
- For each cell:
    - Loop through the digits 1 to 9
    - For each digit, count the number of times that digit appears in the row_candidates list, the column_candidates list, and the block_candidates lists.
    - On the same line, sum the row count, the column count, and the block count to get the total_count.
    - Most importantly, if the total_count is 3, immediately print "FOUND A THREE".
- At the end of each cell, find all the digits which had a total_count of 3 (marked by FOUND A THREE) and list them as the candidates of that cell.
- Everytime you complete a cell print "Cell {current cell number} of {number of cells} complete! {number of cells left} more to go!"
- Then move to the next cell until all are done.
- If there are more than 4 cells, cap the number to check at 4.

- Here is an example with the correct format:
## Cell 1 of {number of cells}
cell(first_row, second_column):
row = first_row_candidates = [1,2,4,6]
column = second_column_candidates = [2,5,6,7,8,9]
block = top_left_block_candidates = [1,2,3,4,6,7]

row.count(1) = 1, column.count(1) = 0, block.count(1) = 1, total_count(1) = 2
row.count(2) = 1, column.count(2) = 1, block.count(2) = 1, total_count(2) = 3 FOUND A THREE
row.count(3) = 0, column.count(3) = 0, block.count(3) = 1, total_count(3) = 1
row.count(4) = 1, column.count(4) = 0, block.count(4) = 1, total_count(4) = 2
row.count(5) = 0, column.count(5) = 1, block.count(5) = 0, total_count(5) = 1
row.count(6) = 1, column.count(6) = 1, block.count(6) = 1, total_count(6) = 3 FOUND A THREE
row.count(7) = 0, column.count(7) = 1, block.count(7) = 1, total_count(7) = 2
row.count(8) = 0, column.count(8) = 1, block.count(8) = 0, total_count(8) = 1
row.count(9) = 0, column.count(9) = 1, block.count(9) = 0, total_count(9) = 1

Confirmed candidates found for cell(first_row, second_column): [2,6]
Cell 1 of 3 complete! 2 more to go!!!

- After you have done All of the cells, list them in one place.
- Example:
## Candidates of the cells
cell(first_row, second_column): [2,6]
cell(second_row, eighth_column): [9]
cell(fourth_row, second_column): [1]

- Make sure to list All the cells, up to a maximum of 4


# STEP_THREE Checking the number of elements in each cell
- For each cell, count the number of elements in the candidates of that cell using .length().
- After each length, either print "length is 1, Passes" if the length is 1, or print "length is {length}, not 1, Rejected" if the length is Not one.
- Example:
cell(first_row, second_column): [2,6]
[2,6].length = number from 2
length is 2, not 1, Rejected

- After doing this for all the cells, list the cells which Passed, making sure Not to list any Rejected cells.
- Example:
## Passing Cells
cell(second_row, eighth_column): [9]
cell(fourth_row, second_column): [1]


# STEP_FOUR: Grouping Cells with Corresponding Rows
- Group each cell from the "Passing Cells" in STEP_THREE with their corresponding row from the current Sudoku. Do not update them yet.
- If there are no passing cells to update, print "There are no cells to update" and move to the next step.
- The current Sudoku is the second message I sent. Since it's so far back print it here (in the exact format it appears but without the output tags) to avoid confusing it with the examples.

- Example:
Current Sudoku:
{Current Sudoku Goes Here}

first_row: [0,3,0,0,8,0,4,9,0]
cell(first_row, fourth_column): [5]

fourth_row: [0,4,1,6,7,3,2,5,8]
cell(fourth_row, first_column): [9]

seventh_row: [2,0,4,0,0,0,0,8,0]
cell(seventh_row, eighth_column): [3]


# STEP_FIVE: Applying Cell Updates to Rows
- Now that the cells to update are cleanly grouped with the appropriate rows, confirm the column position and update each appropriate row.
- However, and this is VITAL: If the column position does NOT have a zero, IMMEDIATELY reject that cell and move on to the next.

- Example:
first_row: [0,3,0,0,8,0,4,9,0]
cell(first_row, fourth_column): [5]
The 4th position of the first_row is 0, so we can proceed.
Updating the value in the 4th position of the first_row:
updated_first_row: [0,3,0,5,8,0,4,9,0]

fourth_row: [0,4,1,6,7,3,2,5,8]
cell(fourth_row, first_column): [9]
The 1st position of the fourth_row is 0, so we can proceed.
Updating the value in the 1st position of the fourth_row:
updated_fourth_row: [9,4,1,6,7,3,2,5,8]

seventh_row: [2,0,4,0,0,0,0,8,0]
cell(seventh_row, eighth_column): [3]
The 8th position of the seventh_row is 8, WHICH IS NOT 0. This cell is rejected and will not be updated.


# STEP_SIX: Printing the Updated Sudoku
- Now print the Sudoku using the updated rows
- Specify the rows to update first to be sure they aren't forgotten. Do not include any rejected cells.

- Example:
The rows to update are first and fourth
updated_first_row: [0,3,0,5,8,0,4,9,0]
second_row: [0,9,2,0,4,1,0,0,0]
third_row: [0,6,0,7,0,9,0,0,5]
updated_fourth_row: [9,4,1,6,7,3,2,5,8]
fifth_row: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3]
sixth_row: [7,8,0,0,5,2,6,0,0]
seventh_row: [2,0,4,0,0,0,0,8,0]
eighth_row: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,4]
ninth_row: [0,1,0,0,3,0,0,2,0]


# Standardizing Row Names in the Updated Sudoku
- Print the Sudoku you just updated, but with the the original NAMES for the rows.
- Make sure the elements are from the UPDATED Sudoku in STEP_SIX.
- As there is now an old and an updated Sudoku, both of which look similar, write the following above the updated Sudoku
"The rows to fix the NAMES of are {rows to change}. The elements are the same as in STEP_SIX."

- Example:
The rows to fix the NAMES of are first and fourth. The elements are the same as in STEP_SIX.

first_row: [0,3,0,5,8,0,4,9,0]
second_row: [0,9,2,0,4,1,0,0,0]
third_row: [0,6,0,7,0,9,0,0,5]
fourth_row: [9,4,1,6,7,3,2,5,8]
fifth_row: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3]
sixth_row: [7,8,0,0,5,2,6,0,0]
seventh_row: [2,0,4,0,0,0,0,8,0]
eighth_row: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,4]
ninth_row: [0,1,0,0,3,0,0,2,0]

- Do not modify any other names in the Sudoku.


# STEP_SEVEN: Shifting the Rows of the Sudoku
- Before you output the Sudoku, the top three rows need to shifted to the bottom, like cutting a deck of cards.
- The rows to be in the order: fourth, fifth, sixth, seventh, eighth, ninth, first, second, third.

- Example:
fourth_row: [9,4,1,6,7,3,2,5,8]
fifth_row: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3]
sixth_row: [7,8,0,0,5,2,6,0,0]
seventh_row: [2,0,4,0,0,0,0,8,0]
eighth_row: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,4]
ninth_row: [0,1,0,0,3,0,0,2,0]
first_row: [0,3,0,5,8,0,4,9,0]
second_row: [0,9,2,0,4,1,0,0,0]
third_row: [0,6,0,7,0,9,0,0,5]


# STEP_EIGHT Fixing the Row Names and Outputting the Sudoku
- WITHOUT moving the elements of the Sudoku, standardize the row names.
- Also surround the Sudoku in output tags to clearly mark it as the output.
- Do not write ANYTHING after the closing output tag, as it will interfere with the system extracting your output.

- Example:
<Output>
first_row: [9,4,1,6,7,3,2,5,8]
second_row: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3]
third_row: [7,8,0,0,5,2,6,0,0]
fourth_row: [2,0,4,0,0,0,0,8,0]
fifth_row: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,4]
sixth_row: [0,1,0,0,3,0,0,2,0]
seventh_row: [0,3,0,5,8,0,4,9,0]
eighth_row: [0,9,2,0,4,1,0,0,0]
ninth_row: [0,6,0,7,0,9,0,0,5]
</Output>


# Final notes
- Ensure all outputs are clearly labeled using the simple headers provided in the instructions.
- Do not use code blocks. Just plain text with the headers in the instructions is fine.
- Stop ONLY after completing STEP_EIGHT, writing NOTHING ELSE after you write the final closing output tag.
- Begin

prompt 3 of 3:
You are going to analyze the sudoku you've just been given.
The analysis will come down to one thing, finding the candidate elements for each unfilled square.
To do this, examine the nine rows, the nine columns, and the nine blocks, and find the elements missing from each set.
Then, for each unfilled square (squares with a '0'), examine the elements missing from the row, column, and 3-by-3 block associated with that square, combine them into a set of common candidates, and check to see whether or not there is Exactly one candidate in that set. Everything else follows from that.



# Board State
Trying to play without vision is difficult, so I want you to follow a very specific format.
I want you to print out the current board state using the _exact_ format shown below (replace the example with the current sudoku).
We are also finding the missing elements of each set. So we are taking the current row, column, or block, and calculating the set-wise difference between that row, column, or block, and the digits 1-9 shown in all_digits.
Each block and its missing elements will (between them) exactly cover the digits from 1 to 9 with no duplicates, and with each number appearing exactly once.
## Rows
all_digits = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]

Print all nine rows and row_missing_elements using the format:
row: [row], row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([row]) = [row_missing_elements]

Examples:
first_row: [1,0,3,4,5,6,0,0,9], first_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([1,0,3,4,5,6,0,0,9]) = [2,7,8]
second_row: [4,5,6,7,8,9,1,2,3], second_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([4,5,6,7,8,9,1,2,3]) = []
third_row: [7,8,0,1,2,3,4,5,6], third_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([7,8,0,1,2,3,4,5,6]) = [9]
fourth_row: [2,3,4,5,6,7,8,0,1], fourth_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([2,3,4,5,6,7,8,0,1]) = [9]
fifth_row: [5,6,7,8,9,1,2,3,4], fifth_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([5,6,7,8,9,1,2,3,4]) = []
sixth_row: [8,9,1,2,0,4,5,6,7], sixth_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([8,9,1,2,0,4,5,6,7]) = [3]
seventh_row: [3,4,5,6,7,8,9,1,2], seventh_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([3,4,5,6,7,8,9,1,2]) = []
eighth_row: [6,0,8,9,1,2,3,0,5], eighth_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([6,0,8,9,1,2,3,0,5]) = [4,7]
ninth_row: [9,0,2,0,4,5,0,7,8], ninth_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([9,0,2,0,4,5,0,7,8]) = [1,3,6]


## Columns
all_digits = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]

Format:
column: [column], column_missing_elements: [all_digits].difference([column]) = [column_missing_elements]

Examples:
first_column: [1,4,7,2,5,8,3,6,9] first_column_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([1,4,7,2,5,8,3,6,9]) = []
second_column: [0,5,8,3,6,9,4,0,0] second_column_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([0,5,8,3,6,9,4,0,0]) = [1,2,7]
third_column: [3,6,0,4,7,1,5,8,2] third_column_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([3,6,0,4,7,1,5,8,2]) = [9]
fourth_column: 

## Blocks
all_digits = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]

Format:
block: (rows: rows in the block; columns: columns in the block):
[block]
block_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([block]) = [block_missing_elements]

Examples:
top_left_block: (rows: first_row, second_row, third_row; columns: first_column, second_column, third_column)
[[1,0,3],
[4,5,6],
[7,8,0]]
top_left_block_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([1,0,3,4,5,6,7,8,0]) = [2,9]

top_middle_block: (rows: first_row, second_row, third_row; columns: fourth_column, fifth_column, sixth_column)
[[4,5,6],
[7,8,9],
[1,2,3]]
top_middle_block_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([4,5,6,7,8,9,1,2,3]) = []

top_right_block: (rows: first_row, second_row, third_row; columns: seventh_column, eighth_column, ninth_column)
[[0,0,9],
[1,2,3],
[4,5,6]]
top_right_block_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([0,0,9,1,2,3,4,5,6]) = [7,8]

middle_left_block: (rows: fourth_row, fifth_row, sixth_row; columns: first_column, second_column, third_column)



# Finding and counting the zero elements
## The positions of the zeroes
For each row we do the following calculations:
row_unfilled_indices: [row].index(0) = [index of every '0' element in the row]
row_unfilled_positions: row_unfilled_indices.increment(1) = [each index incremented by 1]
row_unfilled_columns: the word versions of the positions of the zeroes

Use the following format:
first_row_unfilled_indices: [1,0,3,4,5,6,0,0,9].index(0) = [1,6,7]
first_row_unfilled_positions: first_row_unfilled_indices.increment(1) = [2,7,8]
first_row_unfilled_columns: second, seventh, eighth


## Calculate the number of unfilled squares
A simple one line calculation By Hand to get the total number of unfilled squares:
total_unfilled_squares = 3 + 0 + 1 + 1 + 0 + 1 + 0 + 2 + 3 = 11

Then we cap the number of squares to list:
number_of_squares_to_list = min(total_unfilled_squares, 17) = 11



# Candidate analysis
## Common candidates in each unfilled square
Go through each unfilled square and list the missing elements for the row, column, and block containing that square (use the row and column to get the correct block).
Calculate the elements that are in Both the row, AND the column. Make sure to find ALL of them.
Then calculate the elements that are in Both STEP_A (the previous result), AND the block. Make sure to find ALL of them.

Make sure to ONLY do unfilled squares, which we calculated in the section 'The positions of the zeroes'.
For each unfilled square we examine, we do the following calculations (example below):
STEP_A = row_missing_elements.intersection(column_missing_elements) = [elements in both row_missing_elements AND column_missing_elements]
STEP_B = STEP_A.intersection(block_missing_elements) = [elements in both STEP_A AND block_missing_elements]
common_missing_elements: [STEP_B]
FOUND: square(row, column) (print this line if there is Only one common_missing_element in that square, otherwise leave this line blank and keep going)

Example:
### first_row_unfilled_columns: second, seventh, eighth
#### 1 of {number_of_squares_to_list}
(first_row, second_column):
Using first_row_missing_elements, second_column_missing_elements, and top_left_block_missing_elements (do not list the elements here, just the set names)
STEP_A: [2,7,8].intersection([1,2,7]) = [2,7]
STEP_B: [2,7].intersection([2,9]) = [2]
common_missing_elements: [2]
FOUND: square(first_row, second_column) (If the square has one only one common_missing_element, also print "FOUND ONE: square(row, column)" like this, then keep going)

When we have done as many unfilled squares as specified by number_of_squares_to_list, we stop listing squares and print:
"Finished printing 17 out of 17 squares" (using appropriate numbers)

# Outputting the found squares
## Collating Results
For Every unfilled square that had ONLY one common element (marked with "FOUND: square(row, column)"), we list them below so they are all in one place.

FOUND: square(first_row, second_column)

Make sure to list ALL of them

If there where none, instead print "There were no unfilled squares with only one common_missing_element"


## Unbiased Results
Finally, for every square in the results, we need to list them in the following format:
square(first_row, second_column)
first_row_missing_elements = [2,7,8]
second_column_missing_elements = [1,2,7]
top_left_block_missing_elements = [2,7]

Note that neither of the output sections lists the common_missing_element found in that square. This is to allow unbiased verification of the results.

Make sure to list all of them

If there where none, instead print "There are no candidate squares"

Follow ALL instructions METHODICALLY and IN FULL. Your task is to calculate the possible candidate elements for the given cells, then to update the non-rejected cells of the given sudoku using the calculated candidate elements, then to shift the rows, and finally to output the updated and shifted sudoku. Once you begin you must complete ALL of these tasks BEFORE stopping. After receiving the full instructions you have ONLY one message to finish the task, as soon as you stop responding the final section of your response is sent to the next part of the process. Thus the final text you write MUST be the updated and shifted Sudoku, in the correct format, after ALL other sections have been completed. Begin as soon as you receive the full instruction set.

prompt 7 of 7:
# Task and background
- My previous message contains the last few hundred characters of a Sudoku analysis.
- You are examining the results in the "Unbiased Results" section of the previous message. Ignore all text before that section.
- The cells given in the section "Unbiased Results" are cells which were found to have only one possible candidate.
- However, the process which found the given cells will sometimes make mistakes, due to having to check so many cells at once.
- Your task is to use the given instructions to perform an independent verification or rejection of the given cells.
- Detailed instructions are provided below, but an overview is as follows:
    - Calculate the possible candidate elements for each cell using the method given below.
    - If a cell has multiple candidates, or fails some other given condition, reject that cell as a mistake made by the previous process.
- Complete all steps starting at STEP_ONE.


# STEP_ONE Extracting Previous Results
- Extract the results of the "Unbiased Results" section in the previous message.
- If there is no section marked "Unbiased Results" in the previous message, that means the start of it was cut off. In that case just start with the first complete cell you can see.
- Only take at most the first FOUR cells of the "Unbiased Results" section, as that's all the system can handle.
- Print the text from that section under the current heading "STEP_ONE Extracting Previous Results". Do not print the heading from the previous message.
- Note: When you print the text, change '_missing_elements' to '_candidates' for the row, column, and block for every cell. Everything else should remain the same.
- These cells will be used in STEP_TWO.


# STEP_TWO Calculating the candidates of each cell
- For each cell from STEP_ONE, use the following method to calculate the candidates of that cell.
- For each cell:
    - Loop through the digits 1 to 9
    - For each digit, count the number of times that digit appears in the row_candidates list, the column_candidates list, and the block_candidates lists.
    - On the same line, sum the row count, the column count, and the block count to get the total_count.
    - Most importantly, if the total_count is 3, immediately print "FOUND A THREE".
- At the end of each cell, find all the digits which had a total_count of 3 (marked by FOUND A THREE) and list them as the candidates of that cell.
- Everytime you complete a cell print "Cell {current cell number} of {number of cells} complete! {number of cells left} more to go!"
- Then move to the next cell until all are done.
- If there are more than 4 cells, cap the number to check at 4.

- Here is an example with the correct format:
## Cell 1 of {number of cells}
cell(first_row, second_column):
row = first_row_candidates = [1,2,4,6]
column = second_column_candidates = [2,5,6,7,8,9]
block = top_left_block_candidates = [1,2,3,4,6,7]

row.count(1) = 1, column.count(1) = 0, block.count(1) = 1, total_count(1) = 2
row.count(2) = 1, column.count(2) = 1, block.count(2) = 1, total_count(2) = 3 FOUND A THREE
row.count(3) = 0, column.count(3) = 0, block.count(3) = 1, total_count(3) = 1
row.count(4) = 1, column.count(4) = 0, block.count(4) = 1, total_count(4) = 2
row.count(5) = 0, column.count(5) = 1, block.count(5) = 0, total_count(5) = 1
row.count(6) = 1, column.count(6) = 1, block.count(6) = 1, total_count(6) = 3 FOUND A THREE
row.count(7) = 0, column.count(7) = 1, block.count(7) = 1, total_count(7) = 2
row.count(8) = 0, column.count(8) = 1, block.count(8) = 0, total_count(8) = 1
row.count(9) = 0, column.count(9) = 1, block.count(9) = 0, total_count(9) = 1

Confirmed candidates found for cell(first_row, second_column): [2,6]
Cell 1 of 3 complete! 2 more to go!!!

- After you have done All of the cells, list them in one place.
- Example:
## Candidates of the cells
cell(first_row, second_column): [2,6]
cell(second_row, eighth_column): [9]
cell(fourth_row, second_column): [1]

- Make sure to list All the cells, up to a maximum of 4


# STEP_THREE Checking the number of elements in each cell
- For each cell, count the number of elements in the candidates of that cell using .length().
- After each length, either print "length is 1, Passes" if the length is 1, or print "length is {length}, not 1, Rejected" if the length is Not one.
- Example:
cell(first_row, second_column): [2,6]
[2,6].length = number from 2
length is 2, not 1, Rejected

- After doing this for all the cells, list the cells which Passed, making sure Not to list any Rejected cells.
- Example:
## Passing Cells
cell(second_row, eighth_column): [9]
cell(fourth_row, second_column): [1]


# STEP_FOUR: Grouping Cells with Corresponding Rows
- Group each cell from the "Passing Cells" in STEP_THREE with their corresponding row from the current Sudoku. Do not update them yet.
- If there are no passing cells to update, print "There are no cells to update" and move to the next step.
- The current Sudoku is the second message I sent. Since it's so far back print it here (in the exact format it appears but without the output tags) to avoid confusing it with the examples.

- Example:
Current Sudoku:
{Current Sudoku Goes Here}

first_row: [0,3,0,0,8,0,4,9,0]
cell(first_row, fourth_column): [5]

fourth_row: [0,4,1,6,7,3,2,5,8]
cell(fourth_row, first_column): [9]

seventh_row: [2,0,4,0,0,0,0,8,0]
cell(seventh_row, eighth_column): [3]


# STEP_FIVE: Applying Cell Updates to Rows
- Now that the cells to update are cleanly grouped with the appropriate rows, confirm the column position and update each appropriate row.
- However, and this is VITAL: If the column position does NOT have a zero, IMMEDIATELY reject that cell and move on to the next.

- Example:
first_row: [0,3,0,0,8,0,4,9,0]
cell(first_row, fourth_column): [5]
The 4th position of the first_row is 0, so we can proceed.
Updating the value in the 4th position of the first_row:
updated_first_row: [0,3,0,5,8,0,4,9,0]

fourth_row: [0,4,1,6,7,3,2,5,8]
cell(fourth_row, first_column): [9]
The 1st position of the fourth_row is 0, so we can proceed.
Updating the value in the 1st position of the fourth_row:
updated_fourth_row: [9,4,1,6,7,3,2,5,8]

seventh_row: [2,0,4,0,0,0,0,8,0]
cell(seventh_row, eighth_column): [3]
The 8th position of the seventh_row is 8, WHICH IS NOT 0. This cell is rejected and will not be updated.


# STEP_SIX: Printing the Updated Sudoku
- Now print the Sudoku using the updated rows
- Specify the rows to update first to be sure they aren't forgotten. Do not include any rejected cells.

- Example:
The rows to update are first and fourth
updated_first_row: [0,3,0,5,8,0,4,9,0]
second_row: [0,9,2,0,4,1,0,0,0]
third_row: [0,6,0,7,0,9,0,0,5]
updated_fourth_row: [9,4,1,6,7,3,2,5,8]
fifth_row: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3]
sixth_row: [7,8,0,0,5,2,6,0,0]
seventh_row: [2,0,4,0,0,0,0,8,0]
eighth_row: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,4]
ninth_row: [0,1,0,0,3,0,0,2,0]


# Standardizing Row Names in the Updated Sudoku
- Print the Sudoku you just updated, but with the the original NAMES for the rows.
- Make sure the elements are from the UPDATED Sudoku in STEP_SIX.
- As there is now an old and an updated Sudoku, both of which look similar, write the following above the updated Sudoku
"The rows to fix the NAMES of are {rows to change}. The elements are the same as in STEP_SIX."

- Example:
The rows to fix the NAMES of are first and fourth. The elements are the same as in STEP_SIX.

first_row: [0,3,0,5,8,0,4,9,0]
second_row: [0,9,2,0,4,1,0,0,0]
third_row: [0,6,0,7,0,9,0,0,5]
fourth_row: [9,4,1,6,7,3,2,5,8]
fifth_row: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3]

# STEP_SEVEN: Shifting the Rows of the Sudoku
- Before you output the Sudoku, the top three rows need to shifted to the bottom, like cutting a deck of cards.
- The rows to be in the order: fourth, fifth, sixth, seventh, eighth, ninth, first, second, third.

- Example:
fourth_row: [9,4,1,6,7,3,2,5,8]
fifth_row: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3]
sixth_row: [7,8,0,0,5,2,6,0,0]
seventh_row: [2,0,4,0,0,0,0,8,0]
eighth_row: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,4]
ninth_row: [0,1,0,0,3,0,0,2,0]
first_row: [0,3,0,5,8,0,4,9,0]
second_row: [0,9,2,0,4,1,0,0,0]
third_row: [0,6,0,7,0,9,0,0,5]


# STEP_EIGHT Fixing the Row Names and Outputting the Sudoku
- WITHOUT moving the elements of the Sudoku, standardize the row names.
- Also surround the Sudoku in output tags to clearly mark it as the output.
- Do not write ANYTHING after the closing output tag, as it will interfere with the system extracting your output.

- Example:
<Output>
first_row: [9,4,1,6,7,3,2,5,8]
second_row: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3]
third_row: [7,8,0,0,5,2,6,0,0]
fourth_row: [2,0,4,0,0,0,0,8,0]
fifth_row: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,4]
sixth_row: [0,1,0,0,3,0,0,2,0]
seventh_row: [0,3,0,5,8,0,4,9,0]
eighth_row: [0,9,2,0,4,1,0,0,0]
ninth_row: [0,6,0,7,0,9,0,0,5]
</Output>


# Final notes
- Ensure all outputs are clearly labeled using the simple headers provided in the instructions.
- Do not use code blocks. Just plain text with the headers in the instructions is fine.
- Stop ONLY after completing STEP_EIGHT, writing NOTHING ELSE after you write the final closing output tag.
- Begin

prompt 3 of 3:
You are going to analyze the sudoku you've just been given.
The analysis will come down to one thing, finding the candidate elements for each unfilled square.
To do this, examine the nine rows, the nine columns, and the nine blocks, and find the elements missing from each set.
Then, for each unfilled square (squares with a '0'), examine the elements missing from the row, column, and 3-by-3 block associated with that square, combine them into a set of common candidates, and check to see whether or not there is Exactly one candidate in that set. Everything else follows from that.



# Board State
Trying to play without vision is difficult, so I want you to follow a very specific format.
I want you to print out the current board state using the _exact_ format shown below (replace the example with the current sudoku).
We are also finding the missing elements of each set. So we are taking the current row, column, or block, and calculating the set-wise difference between that row, column, or block, and the digits 1-9 shown in all_digits.
Each block and its missing elements will (between them) exactly cover the digits from 1 to 9 with no duplicates, and with each number appearing exactly once.
## Rows
all_digits = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]

Print all nine rows and row_missing_elements using the format:
row: [row], row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([row]) = [row_missing_elements]

Examples:
first_row: [1,0,3,4,5,6,0,0,9], first_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([1,0,3,4,5,6,0,0,9]) = [2,7,8]
second_row: [4,5,6,7,8,9,1,2,3], second_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([4,5,6,7,8,9,1,2,3]) = []
third_row: [7,8,0,1,2,3,4,5,6], third_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([7,8,0,1,2,3,4,5,6]) = [9]
fourth_row: [2,3,4,5,6,7,8,0,1], fourth_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([2,3,4,5,6,7,8,0,1]) = [9]
fifth_row: [5,6,7,8,9,1,2,3,4], fifth_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([5,6,7,8,9,1,2,3,4]) = []
sixth_row: [8,9,1,2,0,4,5,6,7], sixth_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([8,9,1,2,0,4,5,6,7]) = [3]
seventh_row: [3,4,5,6,7,8,9,1,2], seventh_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([3,4,5,6,7,8,9,1,2]) = []
eighth_row: [6,0,8,9,1,2,3,0,5], eighth_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([6,0,8,9,1,2,3,0,5]) = [4,7]
ninth_row: [9,0,2,0,4,5,0,7,8], ninth_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([9,0,2,0,4,5,0,7,8]) = [1,3,6]


## Columns
all_digits = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]

Format:
column: [column], column_missing_elements: [all_digits].difference([column]) = [column_missing_elements]

Examples:
first_column: [1,4,7,2,5,8,3,6,9] first_column_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([1,4,7,2,5,8,3,6,9]) = []
second_column: [0,5,8,3,6,9,4,0,0] second_column_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([0,5,8,3,6,9,4,0,0]) = [1,2,7]
third_column: [3,6,0,4,7,1,5,8,2] third_column_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([3,6,0,4,7,1,5,8,2]) = [9]
fourth_column: 

## Blocks
all_digits = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]

Format:
block: (rows: rows in the block; columns: columns in the block):
[block]
block_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([block]) = [block_missing_elements]

Examples:
top_left_block: (rows: first_row, second_row, third_row; columns: first_column, second_column, third_column)
[[1,0,3],
[4,5,6],
[7,8,0]]
top_left_block_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([1,0,3,4,5,6,7,8,0]) = [2,9]

top_middle_block: (rows: first_row, second_row, third_row; columns: fourth_column, fifth_column, sixth_column)
[[4,5,6],
[7,8,9],
[1,2,3]]
top_middle_block_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([4,5,6,7,8,9,1,2,3]) = []

top_right_block: (rows: first_row, second_row, third_row; columns: seventh_column, eighth_column, ninth_column)
[[0,0,9],
[1,2,3],
[4,5,6]]
top_right_block_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([0,0,9,1,2,3,4,5,6]) = [7,8]

middle_left_block: (rows: fourth_row, fifth_row, sixth_row; columns: first_column, second_column, third_column)



# Finding and counting the zero elements
## The positions of the zeroes
For each row we do the following calculations:
row_unfilled_indices: [row].index(0) = [index of every '0' element in the row]
row_unfilled_positions: row_unfilled_indices.increment(1) = [each index incremented by 1]
row_unfilled_columns: the word versions of the positions of the zeroes

Use the following format:
first_row_unfilled_indices: [1,0,3,4,5,6,0,0,9].index(0) = [1,6,7]
first_row_unfilled_positions: first_row_unfilled_indices.increment(1) = [2,7,8]
first_row_unfilled_columns: second, seventh, eighth


## Calculate the number of unfilled squares
A simple one line calculation By Hand to get the total number of unfilled squares:
total_unfilled_squares = 3 + 0 + 1 + 1 + 0 + 1 + 0 + 2 + 3 = 11

Then we cap the number of squares to list:
number_of_squares_to_list = min(total_unfilled_squares, 17) = 11



# Candidate analysis
## Common candidates in each unfilled square
Go through each unfilled square and list the missing elements for the row, column, and block containing that square (use the row and column to get the correct block).
Calculate the elements that are in Both the row, AND the column. Make sure to find ALL of them.
Then calculate the elements that are in Both STEP_A (the previous result), AND the block. Make sure to find ALL of them.

Make sure to ONLY do unfilled squares, which we calculated in the section 'The positions of the zeroes'.
For each unfilled square we examine, we do the following calculations (example below):
STEP_A = row_missing_elements.intersection(column_missing_elements) = [elements in both row_missing_elements AND column_missing_elements]
STEP_B = STEP_A.intersection(block_missing_elements) = [elements in both STEP_A AND block_missing_elements]
common_missing_elements: [STEP_B]
FOUND: square(row, column) (print this line if there is Only one common_missing_element in that square, otherwise leave this line blank and keep going)

Example:
### first_row_unfilled_columns: second, seventh, eighth
#### 1 of {number_of_squares_to_list}
(first_row, second_column):
Using first_row_missing_elements, second_column_missing_elements, and top_left_block_missing_elements (do not list the elements here, just the set names)
STEP_A: [2,7,8].intersection([1,2,7]) = [2,7]
STEP_B: [2,7].intersection([2,9]) = [2]
common_missing_elements: [2]
FOUND: square(first_row, second_column) (If the square has one only one common_missing_element, also print "FOUND ONE: square(row, column)" like this, then keep going)

When we have done as many unfilled squares as specified by number_of_squares_to_list, we stop listing squares and print:
"Finished printing 17 out of 17 squares" (using appropriate numbers)

# Outputting the found squares
## Collating Results
For Every unfilled square that had ONLY one common element (marked with "FOUND: square(row, column)"), we list them below so they are all in one place.

FOUND: square(first_row, second_column)

Make sure to list ALL of them

If there where none, instead print "There were no unfilled squares with only one common_missing_element"


## Unbiased Results
Finally, for every square in the results, we need to list them in the following format:
square(first_row, second_column)
first_row_missing_elements = [2,7,8]
second_column_missing_elements = [1,2,7]
top_left_block_missing_elements = [2,7]

Note that neither of the output sections lists the common_missing_element found in that square. This is to allow unbiased verification of the results.

Make sure to list all of them

If there where none, instead print "There are no candidate squares"

Follow ALL instructions METHODICALLY and IN FULL. Your task is to calculate the possible candidate elements for the given cells, then to update the non-rejected cells of the given sudoku using the calculated candidate elements, then to shift the rows, and finally to output the updated and shifted sudoku. Once you begin you must complete ALL of these tasks BEFORE stopping. After receiving the full instructions you have ONLY one message to finish the task, as soon as you stop responding the final section of your response is sent to the next part of the process. Thus the final text you write MUST be the updated and shifted Sudoku, in the correct format, after ALL other sections have been completed. Begin as soon as you receive the full instruction set.

# Task and background
- My previous message contains the last few hundred characters of a Sudoku analysis.
- You are examining the results in the "Unbiased Results" section of the previous message. Ignore all text before that section.
- The cells given in the section "Unbiased Results" are cells which were found to have only one possible candidate.
- However, the process which found the given cells will sometimes make mistakes, due to having to check so many cells at once.
- Your task is to use the given instructions to perform an independent verification or rejection of the given cells.
- Detailed instructions are provided below, but an overview is as follows:
    - Calculate the possible candidate elements for each cell using the method given below.
    - If a cell has multiple candidates, or fails some other given condition, reject that cell as a mistake made by the previous process.
- Complete all steps starting at STEP_ONE.


# STEP_ONE Extracting Previous Results
- Extract the results of the "Unbiased Results" section in the previous message.
- If there is no section marked "Unbiased Results" in the previous message, that means the start of it was cut off. In that case just start with the first complete cell you can see.
- Only take at most the first FOUR cells of the "Unbiased Results" section, as that's all the system can handle.
- Print the text from that section under the current heading "STEP_ONE Extracting Previous Results". Do not print the heading from the previous message.
- Note: When you print the text, change '_missing_elements' to '_candidates' for the row, column, and block for every cell. Everything else should remain the same.
- These cells will be used in STEP_TWO.


# STEP_TWO Calculating the candidates of each cell
- For each cell from STEP_ONE, use the following method to calculate the candidates of that cell.
- For each cell:
    - Loop through the digits 1 to 9
    - For each digit, count the number of times that digit appears in the row_candidates list, the column_candidates list, and the block_candidates lists.
    - On the same line, sum the row count, the column count, and the block count to get the total_count.
    - Most importantly, if the total_count is 3, immediately print "FOUND A THREE".
- At the end of each cell, find all the digits which had a total_count of 3 (marked by FOUND A THREE) and list them as the candidates of that cell.
- Everytime you complete a cell print "Cell {current cell number} of {number of cells} complete! {number of cells left} more to go!"
- Then move to the next cell until all are done.
- If there are more than 4 cells, cap the number to check at 4.

- Here is an example with the correct format:
## Cell 1 of {number of cells}
cell(first_row, second_column):
row = first_row_candidates = [1,2,4,6]
column = second_column_candidates = [2,5,6,7,8,9]
block = top_left_block_candidates = [1,2,3,4,6,7]

row.count(1) = 1, column.count(1) = 0, block.count(1) = 1, total_count(1) = 2
row.count(2) = 1, column.count(2) = 1, block.count(2) = 1, total_count(2) = 3 FOUND A THREE
row.count(3) = 0, column.count(3) = 0, block.count(3) = 1, total_count(3) = 1
row.count(4) = 1, column.count(4) = 0, block.count(4) = 1, total_count(4) = 2
row.count(5) = 0, column.count(5) = 1, block.count(5) = 0, total_count(5) = 1
row.count(6) = 1, column.count(6) = 1, block.count(6) = 1, total_count(6) = 3 FOUND A THREE
row.count(7) = 0, column.count(7) = 1, block.count(7) = 1, total_count(7) = 2
row.count(8) = 0, column.count(8) = 1, block.count(8) = 0, total_count(8) = 1
row.count(9) = 0, column.count(9) = 1, block.count(9) = 0, total_count(9) = 1

Confirmed candidates found for cell(first_row, second_column): [2,6]
Cell 1 of 3 complete! 2 more to go!!!

- After you have done All of the cells, list them in one place.
- Example:
## Candidates of the cells
cell(first_row, second_column): [2,6]
cell(second_row, eighth_column): [9]
cell(fourth_row, second_column): [1]

- Make sure to list All the cells, up to a maximum of 4


# STEP_THREE Checking the number of elements in each cell
- For each cell, count the number of elements in the candidates of that cell using .length().
- After each length, either print "length is 1, Passes" if the length is 1, or print "length is {length}, not 1, Rejected" if the length is Not one.
- Example:
cell(first_row, second_column): [2,6]
[2,6].length = number from 2
length is 2, not 1, Rejected

- After doing this for all the cells, list the cells which Passed, making sure Not to list any Rejected cells.
- Example:
## Passing Cells
cell(second_row, eighth_column): [9]
cell(fourth_row, second_column): [1]


# STEP_FOUR: Grouping Cells with Corresponding Rows
- Group each cell from the "Passing Cells" in STEP_THREE with their corresponding row from the current Sudoku. Do not update them yet.
- If there are no passing cells to update, print "There are no cells to update" and move to the next step.
- The current Sudoku is the second message I sent. Since it's so far back print it here (in the exact format it appears but without the output tags) to avoid confusing it with the examples.

- Example:
Current Sudoku:
{Current Sudoku Goes Here}

first_row: [0,3,0,0,8,0,4,9,0]
cell(first_row, fourth_column): [5]

fourth_row: [0,4,1,6,7,3,2,5,8]
cell(fourth_row, first_column): [9]

seventh_row: [2,0,4,0,0,0,0,8,0]
cell(seventh_row, eighth_column): [3]


# STEP_FIVE: Applying Cell Updates to Rows
- Now that the cells to update are cleanly grouped with the appropriate rows, confirm the column position and update each appropriate row.
- However, and this is VITAL: If the column position does NOT have a zero, IMMEDIATELY reject that cell and move on to the next.

- Example:
first_row: [0,3,0,0,8,0,4,9,0]
cell(first_row, fourth_column): [5]
The 4th position of the first_row is 0, so we can proceed.
Updating the value in the 4th position of the first_row:
updated_first_row: [0,3,0,5,8,0,4,9,0]

fourth_row: [0,4,1,6,7,3,2,5,8]
cell(fourth_row, first_column): [9]
The 1st position of the fourth_row is 0, so we can proceed.
Updating the value in the 1st position of the fourth_row:
updated_fourth_row: [9,4,1,6,7,3,2,5,8]

seventh_row: [2,0,4,0,0,0,0,8,0]
cell(seventh_row, eighth_column): [3]
The 8th position of the seventh_row is 8, WHICH IS NOT 0. This cell is rejected and will not be updated.


# STEP_SIX: Printing the Updated Sudoku
- Now print the Sudoku using the updated rows
- Specify the rows to update first to be sure they aren't forgotten. Do not include any rejected cells.

- Example:
The rows to update are first and fourth
updated_first_row: [0,3,0,5,8,0,4,9,0]
second_row: [0,9,2,0,4,1,0,0,0]
third_row: [0,6,0,7,0,9,0,0,5]
updated_fourth_row: [9,4,1,6,7,3,2,5,8]
fifth_row: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3]
sixth_row: [7,8,0,0,5,2,6,0,0]
seventh_row: [2,0,4,0,0,0,0,8,0]
eighth_row: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,4]
ninth_row: [0,1,0,0,3,0,0,2,0]


# Standardizing Row Names in the Updated Sudoku
- Print the Sudoku you just updated, but with the the original NAMES for the rows.
- Make sure the elements are from the UPDATED Sudoku in STEP_SIX.
- As there is now an old and an updated Sudoku, both of which look similar, write the following above the updated Sudoku
"The rows to fix the NAMES of are {rows to change}. The elements are the same as in STEP_SIX."

- Example:
The rows to fix the NAMES of are first and fourth. The elements are the same as in STEP_SIX.

first_row: [0,3,0,5,8,0,4,9,0]
second_row: [0,9,2,0,4,1,0,0,0]
third_row: [0,6,0,7,0,9,0,0,5]
fourth_row: [9,4,1,6,7,3,2,5,8]
fifth_row: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3]
sixth_row: [7,8,0,0,5,2,6,0,0]
seventh_row: [2,0,4,0,0,0,0,8,0]
eighth_row: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,4]
ninth_row: [0,1,0,0,3,0,0,2,0]

- Do not modify any other names in the Sudoku.


# STEP_SEVEN: Shifting the Rows of the Sudoku
- Before you output the Sudoku, the top three rows need to shifted to the bottom, like cutting a deck of cards.
- The rows to be in the order: fourth, fifth, sixth, seventh, eighth, ninth, first, second, third.

- Example:
fourth_row: [9,4,1,6,7,3,2,5,8]
fifth_row: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3]
sixth_row: [7,8,0,0,5,2,6,0,0]
seventh_row: [2,0,4,0,0,0,0,8,0]
eighth_row: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,4]
ninth_row: [0,1,0,0,3,0,0,2,0]
first_row: [0,3,0,5,8,0,4,9,0]
second_row: [0,9,2,0,4,1,0,0,0]
third_row: [0,6,0,7,0,9,0,0,5]


# STEP_EIGHT Fixing the Row Names and Outputting the Sudoku
- WITHOUT moving the elements of the Sudoku, standardize the row names.
- Also surround the Sudoku in output tags to clearly mark it as the output.
- Do not write ANYTHING after the closing output tag, as it will interfere with the system extracting your output.

- Example:
<Output>
first_row: [9,4,1,6,7,3,2,5,8]
second_row: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3]
third_row: [7,8,0,0,5,2,6,0,0]
fourth_row: [2,0,4,0,0,0,0,8,0]
fifth_row: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,4]
sixth_row: [0,1,0,0,3,0,0,2,0]
seventh_row: [0,3,0,5,8,0,4,9,0]
eighth_row: [0,9,2,0,4,1,0,0,0]
ninth_row: [0,6,0,7,0,9,0,0,5]
</Output>


# Final notes
- Ensure all outputs are clearly labeled using the simple headers provided in the instructions.
- Do not use code blocks. Just plain text with the headers in the instructions is fine.
- Stop ONLY after completing STEP_EIGHT, writing NOTHING ELSE after you write the final closing output tag.
- Begin

prompt 3 of 3:
You are going to analyze the sudoku you've just been given.
The analysis will come down to one thing, finding the candidate elements for each unfilled square.
To do this, examine the nine rows, the nine columns, and the nine blocks, and find the elements missing from each set.
Then, for each unfilled square (squares with a '0'), examine the elements missing from the row, column, and 3-by-3 block associated with that square, combine them into a set of common candidates, and check to see whether or not there is Exactly one candidate in that set. Everything else follows from that.



# Board State
Trying to play without vision is difficult, so I want you to follow a very specific format.
I want you to print out the current board state using the _exact_ format shown below (replace the example with the current sudoku).
We are also finding the missing elements of each set. So we are taking the current row, column, or block, and calculating the set-wise difference between that row, column, or block, and the digits 1-9 shown in all_digits.
Each block and its missing elements will (between them) exactly cover the digits from 1 to 9 with no duplicates, and with each number appearing exactly once.
## Rows
all_digits = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]

Print all nine rows and row_missing_elements using the format:
row: [row], row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([row]) = [row_missing_elements]

Examples:
first_row: [1,0,3,4,5,6,0,0,9], first_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([1,0,3,4,5,6,0,0,9]) = [2,7,8]
second_row: [4,5,6,7,8,9,1,2,3], second_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([4,5,6,7,8,9,1,2,3]) = []
third_row: [7,8,0,1,2,3,4,5,6], third_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([7,8,0,1,2,3,4,5,6]) = [9]
fourth_row: [2,3,4,5,6,7,8,0,1], fourth_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([2,3,4,5,6,7,8,0,1]) = [9]
fifth_row: [5,6,7,8,9,1,2,3,4], fifth_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([5,6,7,8,9,1,2,3,4]) = []
sixth_row: [8,9,1,2,0,4,5,6,7], sixth_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([8,9,1,2,0,4,5,6,7]) = [3]
seventh_row: [3,4,5,6,7,8,9,1,2], seventh_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([3,4,5,6,7,8,9,1,2]) = []
eighth_row: [6,0,8,9,1,2,3,0,5], eighth_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([6,0,8,9,1,2,3,0,5]) = [4,7]
ninth_row: [9,0,2,0,4,5,0,7,8], ninth_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([9,0,2,0,4,5,0,7,8]) = [1,3,6]


## Columns
all_digits = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]

Format:
column: [column], column_missing_elements: [all_digits].difference([column]) = [column_missing_elements]

Examples:
first_column: [1,4,7,2,5,8,3,6,9] first_column_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([1,4,7,2,5,8,3,6,9]) = []
second_column: [0,5,8,3,6,9,4,0,0] second_column_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([0,5,8,3,6,9,4,0,0]) = [1,2,7]
third_column: [3,6,0,4,7,1,5,8,2] third_column_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([3,6,0,4,7,1,5,8,2]) = [9]
fourth_column: 

## Blocks
all_digits = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]

Format:
block: (rows: rows in the block; columns: columns in the block):
[block]
block_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([block]) = [block_missing_elements]

Examples:
top_left_block: (rows: first_row, second_row, third_row; columns: first_column, second_column, third_column)
[[1,0,3],
[4,5,6],
[7,8,0]]
top_left_block_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([1,0,3,4,5,6,7,8,0]) = [2,9]

top_middle_block: (rows: first_row, second_row, third_row; columns: fourth_column, fifth_column, sixth_column)

# Finding and counting the zero elements
## The positions of the zeroes
For each row we do the following calculations:
row_unfilled_indices: [row].index(0) = [index of every '0' element in the row]
row_unfilled_positions: row_unfilled_indices.increment(1) = [each index incremented by 1]
row_unfilled_columns: the word versions of the positions of the zeroes

Use the following format:
first_row_unfilled_indices: [1,0,3,4,5,6,0,0,9].index(0) = [1,6,7]
first_row_unfilled_positions: first_row_unfilled_indices.increment(1) = [2,7,8]
first_row_unfilled_columns: second, seventh, eighth


## Calculate the number of unfilled squares
A simple one line calculation By Hand to get the total number of unfilled squares:
total_unfilled_squares = 3 + 0 + 1 + 1 + 0 + 1 + 0 + 2 + 3 = 11

Then we cap the number of squares to list:
number_of_squares_to_list = min(total_unfilled_squares, 17) = 11



# Candidate analysis
## Common candidates in each unfilled square
Go through each unfilled square and list the missing elements for the row, column, and block containing that square (use the row and column to get the correct block).
Calculate the elements that are in Both the row, AND the column. Make sure to find ALL of them.
Then calculate the elements that are in Both STEP_A (the previous result), AND the block. Make sure to find ALL of them.

Make sure to ONLY do unfilled squares, which we calculated in the section 'The positions of the zeroes'.
For each unfilled square we examine, we do the following calculations (example below):
STEP_A = row_missing_elements.intersection(column_missing_elements) = [elements in both row_missing_elements AND column_missing_elements]
STEP_B = STEP_A.intersection(block_missing_elements) = [elements in both STEP_A AND block_missing_elements]
common_missing_elements: [STEP_B]
FOUND: square(row, column) (print this line if there is Only one common_missing_element in that square, otherwise leave this line blank and keep going)

Example:
### first_row_unfilled_columns: second, seventh, eighth
#### 1 of {number_of_squares_to_list}
(first_row, second_column):
Using first_row_missing_elements, second_column_missing_elements, and top_left_block_missing_elements (do not list the elements here, just the set names)
STEP_A: [2,7,8].intersection([1,2,7]) = [2,7]
STEP_B: [2,7].intersection([2,9]) = [2]
common_missing_elements: [2]
FOUND: square(first_row, second_column) (If the square has one only one common_missing_element, also print "FOUND ONE: square(row, column)" like this, then keep going)

When we have done as many unfilled squares as specified by number_of_squares_to_list, we stop listing squares and print:
"Finished printing 17 out of 17 squares" (using appropriate numbers)

# Outputting the found squares
## Collating Results
For Every unfilled square that had ONLY one common element (marked with "FOUND: square(row, column)"), we list them below so they are all in one place.

FOUND: square(first_row, second_column)

Make sure to list ALL of them

If there where none, instead print "There were no unfilled squares with only one common_missing_element"


## Unbiased Results
Finally, for every square in the results, we need to list them in the following format:
square(first_row, second_column)
first_row_missing_elements = [2,7,8]
second_column_missing_elements = [1,2,7]
top_left_block_missing_elements = [2,7]

Note that neither of the output sections lists the common_missing_element found in that square. This is to allow unbiased verification of the results.

Make sure to list all of them

If there where none, instead print "There are no candidate squares"

# Task and background
- My previous message contains the last few hundred characters of a Sudoku analysis.
- You are examining the results in the "Unbiased Results" section of the previous message. Ignore all text before that section.
- The cells given in the section "Unbiased Results" are cells which were found to have only one possible candidate.
- However, the process which found the given cells will sometimes make mistakes, due to having to check so many cells at once.
- Your task is to use the given instructions to perform an independent verification or rejection of the given cells.
- Detailed instructions are provided below, but an overview is as follows:
    - Calculate the possible candidate elements for each cell using the method given below.
    - If a cell has multiple candidates, or fails some other given condition, reject that cell as a mistake made by the previous process.
- Complete all steps starting at STEP_ONE.


# STEP_ONE Extracting Previous Results
- Extract the results of the "Unbiased Results" section in the previous message.
- If there is no section marked "Unbiased Results" in the previous message, that means the start of it was cut off. In that case just start with the first complete cell you can see.
- Only take at most the first FOUR cells of the "Unbiased Results" section, as that's all the system can handle.
- Print the text from that section under the current heading "STEP_ONE Extracting Previous Results". Do not print the heading from the previous message.
- Note: When you print the text, change '_missing_elements' to '_candidates' for the row, column, and block for every cell. Everything else should remain the same.
- These cells will be used in STEP_TWO.


# STEP_TWO Calculating the candidates of each cell
- For each cell from STEP_ONE, use the following method to calculate the candidates of that cell.
- For each cell:
    - Loop through the digits 1 to 9
    - For each digit, count the number of times that digit appears in the row_candidates list, the column_candidates list, and the block_candidates lists.
    - On the same line, sum the row count, the column count, and the block count to get the total_count.
    - Most importantly, if the total_count is 3, immediately print "FOUND A THREE".
- At the end of each cell, find all the digits which had a total_count of 3 (marked by FOUND A THREE) and list them as the candidates of that cell.
- Everytime you complete a cell print "Cell {current cell number} of {number of cells} complete! {number of cells left} more to go!"
- Then move to the next cell until all are done.
- If there are more than 4 cells, cap the number to check at 4.

- Here is an example with the correct format:
## Cell 1 of {number of cells}
cell(first_row, second_column):
row = first_row_candidates = [1,2,4,6]
column = second_column_candidates = [2,5,6,7,8,9]
block = top_left_block_candidates = [1,2,3,4,6,7]

row.count(1) = 1, column.count(1) = 0, block.count(1) = 1, total_count(1) = 2
row.count(2) = 1, column.count(2) = 1, block.count(2) = 1, total_count(2) = 3 FOUND A THREE
row.count(3) = 0, column.count(3) = 0, block.count(3) = 1, total_count(3) = 1
row.count(4) = 1, column.count(4) = 0, block.count(4) = 1, total_count(4) = 2
row.count(5) = 0, column.count(5) = 1, block.count(5) = 0, total_count(5) = 1
row.count(6) = 1, column.count(6) = 1, block.count(6) = 1, total_count(6) = 3 FOUND A THREE
row.count(7) = 0, column.count(7) = 1, block.count(7) = 1, total_count(7) = 2
row.count(8) = 0, column.count(8) = 1, block.count(8) = 0, total_count(8) = 1
row.count(9) = 0, column.count(9) = 1, block.count(9) = 0, total_count(9) = 1

Confirmed candidates found for cell(first_row, second_column): [2,6]
Cell 1 of 3 complete! 2 more to go!!!

- After you have done All of the cells, list them in one place.
- Example:
## Candidates of the cells
cell(first_row, second_column): [2,6]
cell(second_row, eighth_column): [9]
cell(fourth_row, second_column): [1]

- Make sure to list All the cells, up to a maximum of 4


# STEP_THREE Checking the number of elements in each cell
- For each cell, count the number of elements in the candidates of that cell using .length().
- After each length, either print "length is 1, Passes" if the length is 1, or print "length is {length}, not 1, Rejected" if the length is Not one.
- Example:
cell(first_row, second_column): [2,6]
[2,6].length = number from 2
length is 2, not 1, Rejected

- After doing this for all the cells, list the cells which Passed, making sure Not to list any Rejected cells.
- Example:
## Passing Cells
cell(second_row, eighth_column): [9]
cell(fourth_row, second_column): [1]


# STEP_FOUR: Grouping Cells with Corresponding Rows
- Group each cell from the "Passing Cells" in STEP_THREE with their corresponding row from the current Sudoku. Do not update them yet.
- If there are no passing cells to update, print "There are no cells to update" and move to the next step.
- The current Sudoku is the second message I sent. Since it's so far back print it here (in the exact format it appears but without the output tags) to avoid confusing it with the examples.

- Example:
Current Sudoku:
{Current Sudoku Goes Here}

first_row: [0,3,0,0,8,0,4,9,0]
cell(first_row, fourth_column): [5]

fourth_row: [0,4,1,6,7,3,2,5,8]
cell(fourth_row, first_column): [9]

seventh_row: [2,0,4,0,0,0,0,8,0]
cell(seventh_row, eighth_column): [3]


# STEP_FIVE: Applying Cell Updates to Rows
- Now that the cells to update are cleanly grouped with the appropriate rows, confirm the column position and update each appropriate row.
- However, and this is VITAL: If the column position does NOT have a zero, IMMEDIATELY reject that cell and move on to the next.

- Example:
first_row: [0,3,0,0,8,0,4,9,0]
cell(first_row, fourth_column): [5]
The 4th position of the first_row is 0, so we can proceed.
Updating the value in the 4th position of the first_row:
updated_first_row: [0,3,0,5,8,0,4,9,0]

fourth_row: [0,4,1,6,7,3,2,5,8]
cell(fourth_row, first_column): [9]
The 1st position of the fourth_row is 0, so we can proceed.
Updating the value in the 1st position of the fourth_row:
updated_fourth_row: [9,4,1,6,7,3,2,5,8]

seventh_row: [2,0,4,0,0,0,0,8,0]
cell(seventh_row, eighth_column): [3]
The 8th position of the seventh_row is 8, WHICH IS NOT 0. This cell is rejected and will not be updated.


# STEP_SIX: Printing the Updated Sudoku
- Now print the Sudoku using the updated rows
- Specify the rows to update first to be sure they aren't forgotten. Do not include any rejected cells.

- Example:
The rows to update are first and fourth
updated_first_row: [0,3,0,5,8,0,4,9,0]
second_row: [0,9,2,0,4,1,0,0,0]
third_row: [0,6,0,7,0,9,0,0,5]
updated_fourth_row: [9,4,1,6,7,3,2,5,8]
fifth_row: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3]
sixth_row: [7,8,0,0,5,2,6,0,0]
seventh_row: [2,0,4,0,0,0,0,8,0]
eighth_row: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,4]
ninth_row: [0,1,0,0,3,0,0,2,0]


# Standardizing Row Names in the Updated Sudoku
- Print the Sudoku you just updated, but with the the original NAMES for the rows.
- Make sure the elements are from the UPDATED Sudoku in STEP_SIX.
- As there is now an old and an updated Sudoku, both of which look similar, write the following above the updated Sudoku
"The rows to fix the NAMES of are {rows to change}. The elements are the same as in STEP_SIX."

- Example:
The rows to fix the NAMES of are first and fourth. The elements are the same as in STEP_SIX.

first_row: [0,3,0,5,8,0,4,9,0]
second_row: [0,9,2,0,4,1,0,0,0]
third_row: [0,6,0,7,0,9,0,0,5]
fourth_row: [9,4,1,6,7,3,2,5,8]
fifth_row: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3]
sixth_row: [7,8,0,0,5,2,6,0,0]
seventh_row: [2,0,4,0,0,0,0,8,0]
eighth_row: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,4]
ninth_row: [0,1,0,0,3,0,0,2,0]

- Do not modify any other names in the Sudoku.


# STEP_SEVEN: Shifting the Rows of the Sudoku
- Before you output the Sudoku, the top three rows need to shifted to the bottom, like cutting a deck of cards.
- The rows to be in the order: fourth, fifth, sixth, seventh, eighth, ninth, first, second, third.

- Example:
fourth_row: [9,4,1,6,7,3,2,5,8]
fifth_row: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3]
sixth_row: [7,8,0,0,5,2,6,0,0]
seventh_row: [2,0,4,0,0,0,0,8,0]
eighth_row: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,4]
ninth_row: [0,1,0,0,3,0,0,2,0]
first_row: [0,3,0,5,8,0,4,9,0]
second_row: [0,9,2,0,4,1,0,0,0]
third_row: [0,6,0,7,0,9,0,0,5]


# STEP_EIGHT Fixing the Row Names and Outputting the Sudoku
- WITHOUT moving the elements of the Sudoku, standardize the row names.
- Also surround the Sudoku in output tags to clearly mark it as the output.
- Do not write ANYTHING after the closing output tag, as it will interfere with the system extracting your output.

- Example:
<Output>
first_row: [9,4,1,6,7,3,2,5,8]
second_row: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3]
third_row: [7,8,0,0,5,2,6,0,0]
fourth_row: [2,0,4,0,0,0,0,8,0]
fifth_row: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,4]
sixth_row: [0,1,0,0,3,0,0,2,0]
seventh_row: [0,3,0,5,8,0,4,9,0]
eighth_row: [0,9,2,0,4,1,0,0,0]
ninth_row: [0,6,0,7,0,9,0,0,5]
</Output>


# Final notes
- Ensure all outputs are clearly labeled using the simple headers provided in the instructions.
- Do not use code blocks. Just plain text with the headers in the instructions is fine.
- Stop ONLY after completing STEP_EIGHT, writing NOTHING ELSE after you write the final closing output tag.
- Begin

prompt 3 of 3:
You are going to analyze the sudoku you've just been given.
The analysis will come down to one thing, finding the candidate elements for each unfilled square.
To do this, examine the nine rows, the nine columns, and the nine blocks, and find the elements missing from each set.
Then, for each unfilled square (squares with a '0'), examine the elements missing from the row, column, and 3-by-3 block associated with that square, combine them into a set of common candidates, and check to see whether or not there is Exactly one candidate in that set. Everything else follows from that.



# Board State
Trying to play without vision is difficult, so I want you to follow a very specific format.
I want you to print out the current board state using the _exact_ format shown below (replace the example with the current sudoku).
We are also finding the missing elements of each set. So we are taking the current row, column, or block, and calculating the set-wise difference between that row, column, or block, and the digits 1-9 shown in all_digits.
Each block and its missing elements will (between them) exactly cover the digits from 1 to 9 with no duplicates, and with each number appearing exactly once.
## Rows
all_digits = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]

Print all nine rows and row_missing_elements using the format:
row: [row], row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([row]) = [row_missing_elements]

Examples:
first_row: [1,0,3,4,5,6,0,0,9], first_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([1,0,3,4,5,6,0,0,9]) = [2,7,8]
second_row: [4,5,6,7,8,9,1,2,3], second_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([4,5,6,7,8,9,1,2,3]) = []
third_row: [7,8,0,1,2,3,4,5,6], third_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([7,8,0,1,2,3,4,5,6]) = [9]
fourth_row: [2,3,4,5,6,7,8,0,1], fourth_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([2,3,4,5,6,7,8,0,1]) = [9]
fifth_row: [5,6,7,8,9,1,2,3,4], fifth_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([5,6,7,8,9,1,2,3,4]) = []
sixth_row: [8,9,1,2,0,4,5,6,7], sixth_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([8,9,1,2,0,4,5,6,7]) = [3]
seventh_row: [3,4,5,6,7,8,9,1,2], seventh_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([3,4,5,6,7,8,9,1,2]) = []
eighth_row: [6,0,8,9,1,2,3,0,5], eighth_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([6,0,8,9,1,2,3,0,5]) = [4,7]
ninth_row: [9,0,2,0,4,5,0,7,8], ninth_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([9,0,2,0,4,5,0,7,8]) = [1,3,6]


## Columns
all_digits = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]

Format:
column: [column], column_missing_elements: [all_digits].difference([column]) = [column_missing_elements]

Examples:
first_column: [1,4,7,2,5,8,3,6,9] first_column_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([1,4,7,2,5,8,3,6,9]) = []
second_column: [0,5,8,3,6,9,4,0,0] second_column_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([0,5,8,3,6,9,4,0,0]) = [1,2,7]
third_column: [3,6,0,4,7,1,5,8,2] third_column_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([3,6,0,4,7,1,5,8,2]) = [9]
fourth_column: 

## Blocks
all_digits = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]

Format:
block: (rows: rows in the block; columns: columns in the block):
[block]
block_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([block]) = [block_missing_elements]

Examples:
top_left_block: (rows: first_row, second_row, third_row; columns: first_column, second_column, third_column)
[[1,0,3],
[4,5,6],
[7,8,0]]
top_left_block_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([1,0,3,4,5,6,7,8,0]) = [2,9]

top_middle_block: (rows: first_row, second_row, third_row; columns: fourth_column, fifth_column, sixth_column)
[[4,5,6],
[7,8,9],
[1,2,3]]
top_middle_block_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([4,5,6,7,8,9,1,2,3]) = []

top_right_block: (rows: first_row, second_row, third_row; columns: seventh_column, eighth_column, ninth_column)
[[0,0,9],
[1,2,3],
[4,5,6]]
top_right_block_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([0,0,9,1,2,3,4,5,6]) = [7,8]

middle_left_block: (rows: fourth_row, fifth_row, sixth_row; columns: first_column, second_column, third_column)



# Finding and counting the zero elements
## The positions of the zeroes
For each row we do the following calculations:
row_unfilled_indices: [row].index(0) = [index of every '0' element in the row]
row_unfilled_positions: row_unfilled_indices.increment(1) = [each index incremented by 1]
row_unfilled_columns: the word versions of the positions of the zeroes

Use the following format:
first_row_unfilled_indices: [1,0,3,4,5,6,0,0,9].index(0) = [1,6,7]
first_row_unfilled_positions: first_row_unfilled_indices.increment(1) = [2,7,8]
first_row_unfilled_columns: second, seventh, eighth


## Calculate the number of unfilled squares
A simple one line calculation By Hand to get the total number of unfilled squares:
total_unfilled_squares = 3 + 0 + 1 + 1 + 0 + 1 + 0 + 2 + 3 = 11

Then we cap the number of squares to list:
number_of_squares_to_list = min(total_unfilled_squares, 17) = 11



# Candidate analysis
## Common candidates in each unfilled square
Go through each unfilled square and list the missing elements for the row, column, and block containing that square (use the row and column to get the correct block).
Calculate the elements that are in Both the row, AND the column. Make sure to find ALL of them.
Then calculate the elements that are in Both STEP_A (the previous result), AND the block. Make sure to find ALL of them.

Make sure to ONLY do unfilled squares, which we calculated in the section 'The positions of the zeroes'.
For each unfilled square we examine, we do the following calculations (example below):
STEP_A = row_missing_elements.intersection(column_missing_elements) = [elements in both row_missing_elements AND column_missing_elements]
STEP_B = STEP_A.intersection(block_missing_elements) = [elements in both STEP_A AND block_missing_elements]
common_missing_elements: [STEP_B]
FOUND: square(row, column) (print this line if there is Only one common_missing_element in that square, otherwise leave this line blank and keep going)

Example:
### first_row_unfilled_columns: second, seventh, eighth
#### 1 of {number_of_squares_to_list}
(first_row, second_column):
Using first_row_missing_elements, second_column_missing_elements, and top_left_block_missing_elements (do not list the elements here, just the set names)
STEP_A: [2,7,8].intersection([1,2,7]) = [2,7]
STEP_B: [2,7].intersection([2,9]) = [2]
common_missing_elements: [2]
FOUND: square(first_row, second_column) (If the square has one only one common_missing_element, also print "FOUND ONE: square(row, column)" like this, then keep going)

When we have done as many unfilled squares as specified by number_of_squares_to_list, we stop listing squares and print:
"Finished printing 17 out of 17 squares" (using appropriate numbers)

# Outputting the found squares
## Collating Results
For Every unfilled square that had ONLY one common element (marked with "FOUND: square(row, column)"), we list them below so they are all in one place.

FOUND: square(first_row, second_column)

Make sure to list ALL of them

If there where none, instead print "There were no unfilled squares with only one common_missing_element"


## Unbiased Results
Finally, for every square in the results, we need to list them in the following format:
square(first_row, second_column)
first_row_missing_elements = [2,7,8]
second_column_missing_elements = [1,2,7]
top_left_block_missing_elements = [2,7]

Note that neither of the output sections lists the common_missing_element found in that square. This is to allow unbiased verification of the results.

Make sure to list all of them

If there where none, instead print "There are no candidate squares"

    - Calculate the possible candidate elements for each cell using the method given below.
    - If a cell has multiple candidates, or fails some other given condition, reject that cell as a mistake made by the previous process.
- Complete all steps starting at STEP_ONE.


# STEP_ONE Extracting Previous Results
- Extract the results of the "Unbiased Results" section in the previous message.
- If there is no section marked "Unbiased Results" in the previous message, that means the start of it was cut off. In that case just start with the first complete cell you can see.
- Only take at most the first FOUR cells of the "Unbiased Results" section, as that's all the system can handle.
- Print the text from that section under the current heading "STEP_ONE Extracting Previous Results". Do not print the heading from the previous message.
- Note: When you print the text, change '_missing_elements' to '_candidates' for the row, column, and block for every cell. Everything else should remain the same.
- These cells will be used in STEP_TWO.


# STEP_TWO Calculating the candidates of each cell
- For each cell from STEP_ONE, use the following method to calculate the candidates of that cell.
- For each cell:
    - Loop through the digits 1 to 9
    - For each digit, count the number of times that digit appears in the row_candidates list, the column_candidates list, and the block_candidates lists.
    - On the same line, sum the row count, the column count, and the block count to get the total_count.
    - Most importantly, if the total_count is 3, immediately print "FOUND A THREE".
- At the end of each cell, find all the digits which had a total_count of 3 (marked by FOUND A THREE) and list them as the candidates of that cell.
- Everytime you complete a cell print "Cell {current cell number} of {number of cells} complete! {number of cells left} more to go!"
- Then move to the next cell until all are done.
- If there are more than 4 cells, cap the number to check at 4.

- Here is an example with the correct format:
## Cell 1 of {number of cells}
cell(first_row, second_column):
row = first_row_candidates = [1,2,4,6]
column = second_column_candidates = [2,5,6,7,8,9]
block = top_left_block_candidates = [1,2,3,4,6,7]

row.count(1) = 1, column.count(1) = 0, block.count(1) = 1, total_count(1) = 2
row.count(2) = 1, column.count(2) = 1, block.count(2) = 1, total_count(2) = 3 FOUND A THREE
row.count(3) = 0, column.count(3) = 0, block.count(3) = 1, total_count(3) = 1
row.count(4) = 1, column.count(4) = 0, block.count(4) = 1, total_count(4) = 2
row.count(5) = 0, column.count(5) = 1, block.count(5) = 0, total_count(5) = 1
row.count(6) = 1, column.count(6) = 1, block.count(6) = 1, total_count(6) = 3 FOUND A THREE
row.count(7) = 0, column.count(7) = 1, block.count(7) = 1, total_count(7) = 2
row.count(8) = 0, column.count(8) = 1, block.count(8) = 0, total_count(8) = 1
row.count(9) = 0, column.count(9) = 1, block.count(9) = 0, total_count(9) = 1

Confirmed candidates found for cell(first_row, second_column): [2,6]
Cell 1 of 3 complete! 2 more to go!!!

- After you have done All of the cells, list them in one place.
- Example:
## Candidates of the cells
cell(first_row, second_column): [2,6]
cell(second_row, eighth_column): [9]
cell(fourth_row, second_column): [1]

- Make sure to list All the cells, up to a maximum of 4


# STEP_THREE Checking the number of elements in each cell
- For each cell, count the number of elements in the candidates of that cell using .length().
- After each length, either print "length is 1, Passes" if the length is 1, or print "length is {length}, not 1, Rejected" if the length is Not one.
- Example:
cell(first_row, second_column): [2,6]
[2,6].length = number from 2
length is 2, not 1, Rejected

- After doing this for all the cells, list the cells which Passed, making sure Not to list any Rejected cells.
- Example:
## Passing Cells
cell(second_row, eighth_column): [9]
cell(fourth_row, second_column): [1]


# STEP_FOUR: Grouping Cells with Corresponding Rows
- Group each cell from the "Passing Cells" in STEP_THREE with their corresponding row from the current Sudoku. Do not update them yet.
- If there are no passing cells to update, print "There are no cells to update" and move to the next step.
- The current Sudoku is the second message I sent. Since it's so far back print it here (in the exact format it appears but without the output tags) to avoid confusing it with the examples.

- Example:
Current Sudoku:
{Current Sudoku Goes Here}

first_row: [0,3,0,0,8,0,4,9,0]
cell(first_row, fourth_column): [5]

fourth_row: [0,4,1,6,7,3,2,5,8]
cell(fourth_row, first_column): [9]

seventh_row: [2,0,4,0,0,0,0,8,0]
cell(seventh_row, eighth_column): [3]


# STEP_FIVE: Applying Cell Updates to Rows
- Now that the cells to update are cleanly grouped with the appropriate rows, confirm the column position and update each appropriate row.
- However, and this is VITAL: If the column position does NOT have a zero, IMMEDIATELY reject that cell and move on to the next.

- Example:
first_row: [0,3,0,0,8,0,4,9,0]
cell(first_row, fourth_column): [5]
The 4th position of the first_row is 0, so we can proceed.
Updating the value in the 4th position of the first_row:
updated_first_row: [0,3,0,5,8,0,4,9,0]

fourth_row: [0,4,1,6,7,3,2,5,8]
cell(fourth_row, first_column): [9]
The 1st position of the fourth_row is 0, so we can proceed.
Updating the value in the 1st position of the fourth_row:
updated_fourth_row: [9,4,1,6,7,3,2,5,8]

seventh_row: [2,0,4,0,0,0,0,8,0]
cell(seventh_row, eighth_column): [3]
The 8th position of the seventh_row is 8, WHICH IS NOT 0. This cell is rejected and will not be updated.


# STEP_SIX: Printing the Updated Sudoku
- Now print the Sudoku using the updated rows
- Specify the rows to update first to be sure they aren't forgotten. Do not include any rejected cells.

- Example:
The rows to update are first and fourth
updated_first_row: [0,3,0,5,8,0,4,9,0]
second_row: [0,9,2,0,4,1,0,0,0]
third_row: [0,6,0,7,0,9,0,0,5]
updated_fourth_row: [9,4,1,6,7,3,2,5,8]
fifth_row: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3]
sixth_row: [7,8,0,0,5,2,6,0,0]
seventh_row: [2,0,4,0,0,0,0,8,0]
eighth_row: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,4]
ninth_row: [0,1,0,0,3,0,0,2,0]


# Standardizing Row Names in the Updated Sudoku
- Print the Sudoku you just updated, but with the the original NAMES for the rows.
- Make sure the elements are from the UPDATED Sudoku in STEP_SIX.
- As there is now an old and an updated Sudoku, both of which look similar, write the following above the updated Sudoku
"The rows to fix the NAMES of are {rows to change}. The elements are the same as in STEP_SIX."

- Example:
The rows to fix the NAMES of are first and fourth. The elements are the same as in STEP_SIX.

first_row: [0,3,0,5,8,0,4,9,0]
second_row: [0,9,2,0,4,1,0,0,0]
third_row: [0,6,0,7,0,9,0,0,5]
fourth_row: [9,4,1,6,7,3,2,5,8]
fifth_row: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3]
sixth_row: [7,8,0,0,5,2,6,0,0]
seventh_row: [2,0,4,0,0,0,0,8,0]
eighth_row: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,4]
ninth_row: [0,1,0,0,3,0,0,2,0]

- Do not modify any other names in the Sudoku.


# STEP_SEVEN: Shifting the Rows of the Sudoku
- Before you output the Sudoku, the top three rows need to shifted to the bottom, like cutting a deck of cards.
- The rows to be in the order: fourth, fifth, sixth, seventh, eighth, ninth, first, second, third.

- Example:
fourth_row: [9,4,1,6,7,3,2,5,8]
fifth_row: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3]
sixth_row: [7,8,0,0,5,2,6,0,0]
seventh_row: [2,0,4,0,0,0,0,8,0]
eighth_row: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,4]
ninth_row: [0,1,0,0,3,0,0,2,0]
first_row: [0,3,0,5,8,0,4,9,0]
second_row: [0,9,2,0,4,1,0,0,0]
third_row: [0,6,0,7,0,9,0,0,5]


# STEP_EIGHT Fixing the Row Names and Outputting the Sudoku
- WITHOUT moving the elements of the Sudoku, standardize the row names.
- Also surround the Sudoku in output tags to clearly mark it as the output.
- Do not write ANYTHING after the closing output tag, as it will interfere with the system extracting your output.

- Example:
<Output>
first_row: [9,4,1,6,7,3,2,5,8]
second_row: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3]
third_row: [7,8,0,0,5,2,6,0,0]
fourth_row: [2,0,4,0,0,0,0,8,0]
fifth_row: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,4]
sixth_row: [0,1,0,0,3,0,0,2,0]
seventh_row: [0,3,0,5,8,0,4,9,0]
eighth_row: [0,9,2,0,4,1,0,0,0]
ninth_row: [0,6,0,7,0,9,0,0,5]
</Output>


# Final notes
- Ensure all outputs are clearly labeled using the simple headers provided in the instructions.
- Do not use code blocks. Just plain text with the headers in the instructions is fine.
- Stop ONLY after completing STEP_EIGHT, writing NOTHING ELSE after you write the final closing output tag.
- Begin

Then, for each unfilled square (squares with a '0'), examine the elements missing from the row, column, and 3-by-3 block associated with that square, combine them into a set of common candidates, and check to see whether or not there is Exactly one candidate in that set. Everything else follows from that.



# Board State
Trying to play without vision is difficult, so I want you to follow a very specific format.
I want you to print out the current board state using the _exact_ format shown below (replace the example with the current sudoku).
We are also finding the missing elements of each set. So we are taking the current row, column, or block, and calculating the set-wise difference between that row, column, or block, and the digits 1-9 shown in all_digits.
Each block and its missing elements will (between them) exactly cover the digits from 1 to 9 with no duplicates, and with each number appearing exactly once.
## Rows
all_digits = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]

Print all nine rows and row_missing_elements using the format:
row: [row], row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([row]) = [row_missing_elements]

Examples:
first_row: [1,0,3,4,5,6,0,0,9], first_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([1,0,3,4,5,6,0,0,9]) = [2,7,8]
second_row: [4,5,6,7,8,9,1,2,3], second_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([4,5,6,7,8,9,1,2,3]) = []
third_row: [7,8,0,1,2,3,4,5,6], third_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([7,8,0,1,2,3,4,5,6]) = [9]
fourth_row: [2,3,4,5,6,7,8,0,1], fourth_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([2,3,4,5,6,7,8,0,1]) = [9]
fifth_row: [5,6,7,8,9,1,2,3,4], fifth_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([5,6,7,8,9,1,2,3,4]) = []
sixth_row: [8,9,1,2,0,4,5,6,7], sixth_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([8,9,1,2,0,4,5,6,7]) = [3]
seventh_row: [3,4,5,6,7,8,9,1,2], seventh_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([3,4,5,6,7,8,9,1,2]) = []
eighth_row: [6,0,8,9,1,2,3,0,5], eighth_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([6,0,8,9,1,2,3,0,5]) = [4,7]
ninth_row: [9,0,2,0,4,5,0,7,8], ninth_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([9,0,2,0,4,5,0,7,8]) = [1,3,6]


## Columns
all_digits = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]

Format:
column: [column], column_missing_elements: [all_digits].difference([column]) = [column_missing_elements]

Examples:
first_column: [1,4,7,2,5,8,3,6,9] first_column_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([1,4,7,2,5,8,3,6,9]) = []
second_column: [0,5,8,3,6,9,4,0,0] second_column_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([0,5,8,3,6,9,4,0,0]) = [1,2,7]
third_column: [3,6,0,4,7,1,5,8,2] third_column_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([3,6,0,4,7,1,5,8,2]) = [9]
fourth_column: 

## Blocks
all_digits = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]

Format:
block: (rows: rows in the block; columns: columns in the block):
[block]
block_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([block]) = [block_missing_elements]

Examples:
top_left_block: (rows: first_row, second_row, third_row; columns: first_column, second_column, third_column)
[[1,0,3],
[4,5,6],
[7,8,0]]
top_left_block_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([1,0,3,4,5,6,7,8,0]) = [2,9]

top_middle_block: (rows: first_row, second_row, third_row; columns: fourth_column, fifth_column, sixth_column)
[[4,5,6],
[7,8,9],
[1,2,3]]
top_middle_block_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([4,5,6,7,8,9,1,2,3]) = []

top_right_block: (rows: first_row, second_row, third_row; columns: seventh_column, eighth_column, ninth_column)
[[0,0,9],
[1,2,3],
[4,5,6]]
top_right_block_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([0,0,9,1,2,3,4,5,6]) = [7,8]

middle_left_block: (rows: fourth_row, fifth_row, sixth_row; columns: first_column, second_column, third_column)



# Finding and counting the zero elements
## The positions of the zeroes
For each row we do the following calculations:
row_unfilled_indices: [row].index(0) = [index of every '0' element in the row]
row_unfilled_positions: row_unfilled_indices.increment(1) = [each index incremented by 1]
row_unfilled_columns: the word versions of the positions of the zeroes

Use the following format:
first_row_unfilled_indices: [1,0,3,4,5,6,0,0,9].index(0) = [1,6,7]
first_row_unfilled_positions: first_row_unfilled_indices.increment(1) = [2,7,8]
first_row_unfilled_columns: second, seventh, eighth


## Calculate the number of unfilled squares
A simple one line calculation By Hand to get the total number of unfilled squares:
total_unfilled_squares = 3 + 0 + 1 + 1 + 0 + 1 + 0 + 2 + 3 = 11

Then we cap the number of squares to list:
number_of_squares_to_list = min(total_unfilled_squares, 17) = 11



# Candidate analysis
## Common candidates in each unfilled square
Go through each unfilled square and list the missing elements for the row, column, and block containing that square (use the row and column to get the correct block).
Calculate the elements that are in Both the row, AND the column. Make sure to find ALL of them.
Then calculate the elements that are in Both STEP_A (the previous result), AND the block. Make sure to find ALL of them.

Make sure to ONLY do unfilled squares, which we calculated in the section 'The positions of the zeroes'.
For each unfilled square we examine, we do the following calculations (example below):
STEP_A = row_missing_elements.intersection(column_missing_elements) = [elements in both row_missing_elements AND column_missing_elements]
STEP_B = STEP_A.intersection(block_missing_elements) = [elements in both STEP_A AND block_missing_elements]
common_missing_elements: [STEP_B]
FOUND: square(row, column) (print this line if there is Only one common_missing_element in that square, otherwise leave this line blank and keep going)

Example:
### first_row_unfilled_columns: second, seventh, eighth
#### 1 of {number_of_squares_to_list}
(first_row, second_column):
Using first_row_missing_elements, second_column_missing_elements, and top_left_block_missing_elements (do not list the elements here, just the set names)
STEP_A: [2,7,8].intersection([1,2,7]) = [2,7]
STEP_B: [2,7].intersection([2,9]) = [2]
common_missing_elements: [2]
FOUND: square(first_row, second_column) (If the square has one only one common_missing_element, also print "FOUND ONE: square(row, column)" like this, then keep going)

When we have done as many unfilled squares as specified by number_of_squares_to_list, we stop listing squares and print:
"Finished printing 17 out of 17 squares" (using appropriate numbers)

# Outputting the found squares
## Collating Results
For Every unfilled square that had ONLY one common element (marked with "FOUND: square(row, column)"), we list them below so they are all in one place.

FOUND: square(first_row, second_column)

Make sure to list ALL of them

If there where none, instead print "There were no unfilled squares with only one common_missing_element"


## Unbiased Results
Finally, for every square in the results, we need to list them in the following format:
square(first_row, second_column)
first_row_missing_elements = [2,7,8]
second_column_missing_elements = [1,2,7]
top_left_block_missing_elements = [2,7]

Note that neither of the output sections lists the common_missing_element found in that square. This is to allow unbiased verification of the results.

Make sure to list all of them

If there where none, instead print "There are no candidate squares"

# Task and background
- My previous message contains the last few hundred characters of a Sudoku analysis.
- You are examining the results in the "Unbiased Results" section of the previous message. Ignore all text before that section.
- The cells given in the section "Unbiased Results" are cells which were found to have only one possible candidate.
- However, the process which found the given cells will sometimes make mistakes, due to having to check so many cells at once.
- Your task is to use the given instructions to perform an independent verification or rejection of the given cells.
- Detailed instructions are provided below, but an overview is as follows:
    - Calculate the possible candidate elements for each cell using the method given below.
    - If a cell has multiple candidates, or fails some other given condition, reject that cell as a mistake made by the previous process.
- Complete all steps starting at STEP_ONE.


# STEP_ONE Extracting Previous Results
- Extract the results of the "Unbiased Results" section in the previous message.
- If there is no section marked "Unbiased Results" in the previous message, that means the start of it was cut off. In that case just start with the first complete cell you can see.
- Only take at most the first FOUR cells of the "Unbiased Results" section, as that's all the system can handle.
- Print the text from that section under the current heading "STEP_ONE Extracting Previous Results". Do not print the heading from the previous message.
- Note: When you print the text, change '_missing_elements' to '_candidates' for the row, column, and block for every cell. Everything else should remain the same.
- These cells will be used in STEP_TWO.


# STEP_TWO Calculating the candidates of each cell
- For each cell from STEP_ONE, use the following method to calculate the candidates of that cell.
- For each cell:
    - Loop through the digits 1 to 9
    - For each digit, count the number of times that digit appears in the row_candidates list, the column_candidates list, and the block_candidates lists.
    - On the same line, sum the row count, the column count, and the block count to get the total_count.
    - Most importantly, if the total_count is 3, immediately print "FOUND A THREE".
- At the end of each cell, find all the digits which had a total_count of 3 (marked by FOUND A THREE) and list them as the candidates of that cell.
- Everytime you complete a cell print "Cell {current cell number} of {number of cells} complete! {number of cells left} more to go!"
- Then move to the next cell until all are done.
- If there are more than 4 cells, cap the number to check at 4.

- Here is an example with the correct format:
## Cell 1 of {number of cells}

row.count(9) = 0, column.count(9) = 1, block.count(9) = 0, total_count(9) = 1

Confirmed candidates found for cell(first_row, second_column): [2,6]
Cell 1 of 3 complete! 2 more to go!!!

- After you have done All of the cells, list them in one place.
- Example:
## Candidates of the cells
cell(first_row, second_column): [2,6]
cell(second_row, eighth_column): [9]
cell(fourth_row, second_column): [1]

- Make sure to list All the cells, up to a maximum of 4


# STEP_THREE Checking the number of elements in each cell
- For each cell, count the number of elements in the candidates of that cell using .length().
- After each length, either print "length is 1, Passes" if the length is 1, or print "length is {length}, not 1, Rejected" if the length is Not one.
- Example:
cell(first_row, second_column): [2,6]
[2,6].length = number from 2
length is 2, not 1, Rejected

- After doing this for all the cells, list the cells which Passed, making sure Not to list any Rejected cells.
- Example:
## Passing Cells
cell(second_row, eighth_column): [9]
cell(fourth_row, second_column): [1]


# STEP_FOUR: Grouping Cells with Corresponding Rows
- Group each cell from the "Passing Cells" in STEP_THREE with their corresponding row from the current Sudoku. Do not update them yet.
- If there are no passing cells to update, print "There are no cells to update" and move to the next step.
- The current Sudoku is the second message I sent. Since it's so far back print it here (in the exact format it appears but without the output tags) to avoid confusing it with the examples.

- Example:
Current Sudoku:
{Current Sudoku Goes Here}

first_row: [0,3,0,0,8,0,4,9,0]
cell(first_row, fourth_column): [5]

fourth_row: [0,4,1,6,7,3,2,5,8]
cell(fourth_row, first_column): [9]

seventh_row: [2,0,4,0,0,0,0,8,0]
cell(seventh_row, eighth_column): [3]


# STEP_FIVE: Applying Cell Updates to Rows
- Now that the cells to update are cleanly grouped with the appropriate rows, confirm the column position and update each appropriate row.
- However, and this is VITAL: If the column position does NOT have a zero, IMMEDIATELY reject that cell and move on to the next.

- Example:
first_row: [0,3,0,0,8,0,4,9,0]
cell(first_row, fourth_column): [5]
The 4th position of the first_row is 0, so we can proceed.
Updating the value in the 4th position of the first_row:
updated_first_row: [0,3,0,5,8,0,4,9,0]

fourth_row: [0,4,1,6,7,3,2,5,8]
cell(fourth_row, first_column): [9]
The 1st position of the fourth_row is 0, so we can proceed.
Updating the value in the 1st position of the fourth_row:
updated_fourth_row: [9,4,1,6,7,3,2,5,8]

seventh_row: [2,0,4,0,0,0,0,8,0]
cell(seventh_row, eighth_column): [3]
The 8th position of the seventh_row is 8, WHICH IS NOT 0. This cell is rejected and will not be updated.


# STEP_SIX: Printing the Updated Sudoku
- Now print the Sudoku using the updated rows
- Specify the rows to update first to be sure they aren't forgotten. Do not include any rejected cells.

- Example:
The rows to update are first and fourth
updated_first_row: [0,3,0,5,8,0,4,9,0]
second_row: [0,9,2,0,4,1,0,0,0]
third_row: [0,6,0,7,0,9,0,0,5]
updated_fourth_row: [9,4,1,6,7,3,2,5,8]
fifth_row: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3]
sixth_row: [7,8,0,0,5,2,6,0,0]
seventh_row: [2,0,4,0,0,0,0,8,0]
eighth_row: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,4]
ninth_row: [0,1,0,0,3,0,0,2,0]


# Standardizing Row Names in the Updated Sudoku
- Print the Sudoku you just updated, but with the the original NAMES for the rows.
- Make sure the elements are from the UPDATED Sudoku in STEP_SIX.
- As there is now an old and an updated Sudoku, both of which look similar, write the following above the updated Sudoku
"The rows to fix the NAMES of are {rows to change}. The elements are the same as in STEP_SIX."

- Example:
The rows to fix the NAMES of are first and fourth. The elements are the same as in STEP_SIX.

first_row: [0,3,0,5,8,0,4,9,0]
second_row: [0,9,2,0,4,1,0,0,0]
third_row: [0,6,0,7,0,9,0,0,5]
fourth_row: [9,4,1,6,7,3,2,5,8]
fifth_row: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3]
sixth_row: [7,8,0,0,5,2,6,0,0]
seventh_row: [2,0,4,0,0,0,0,8,0]
eighth_row: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,4]
ninth_row: [0,1,0,0,3,0,0,2,0]

- Do not modify any other names in the Sudoku.


# STEP_SEVEN: Shifting the Rows of the Sudoku
- Before you output the Sudoku, the top three rows need to shifted to the bottom, like cutting a deck of cards.
- The rows to be in the order: fourth, fifth, sixth, seventh, eighth, ninth, first, second, third.

- Example:
fourth_row: [9,4,1,6,7,3,2,5,8]
fifth_row: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3]
sixth_row: [7,8,0,0,5,2,6,0,0]
seventh_row: [2,0,4,0,0,0,0,8,0]
eighth_row: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,4]
ninth_row: [0,1,0,0,3,0,0,2,0]
first_row: [0,3,0,5,8,0,4,9,0]
second_row: [0,9,2,0,4,1,0,0,0]
third_row: [0,6,0,7,0,9,0,0,5]


# STEP_EIGHT Fixing the Row Names and Outputting the Sudoku
- WITHOUT moving the elements of the Sudoku, standardize the row names.
- Also surround the Sudoku in output tags to clearly mark it as the output.
- Do not write ANYTHING after the closing output tag, as it will interfere with the system extracting your output.

- Example:
<Output>
first_row: [9,4,1,6,7,3,2,5,8]
second_row: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3]
third_row: [7,8,0,0,5,2,6,0,0]
fourth_row: [2,0,4,0,0,0,0,8,0]
fifth_row: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,4]
sixth_row: [0,1,0,0,3,0,0,2,0]
seventh_row: [0,3,0,5,8,0,4,9,0]
eighth_row: [0,9,2,0,4,1,0,0,0]
ninth_row: [0,6,0,7,0,9,0,0,5]
</Output>


# Final notes
- Ensure all outputs are clearly labeled using the simple headers provided in the instructions.
- Do not use code blocks. Just plain text with the headers in the instructions is fine.
- Stop ONLY after completing STEP_EIGHT, writing NOTHING ELSE after you write the final closing output tag.
- Begin

prompt 3 of 3:
You are going to analyze the sudoku you've just been given.
The analysis will come down to one thing, finding the candidate elements for each unfilled square.
To do this, examine the nine rows, the nine columns, and the nine blocks, and find the elements missing from each set.
Then, for each unfilled square (squares with a '0'), examine the elements missing from the row, column, and 3-by-3 block associated with that square, combine them into a set of common candidates, and check to see whether or not there is Exactly one candidate in that set. Everything else follows from that.



# Board State
Trying to play without vision is difficult, so I want you to follow a very specific format.
I want you to print out the current board state using the _exact_ format shown below (replace the example with the current sudoku).
We are also finding the missing elements of each set. So we are taking the current row, column, or block, and calculating the set-wise difference between that row, column, or block, and the digits 1-9 shown in all_digits.
Each block and its missing elements will (between them) exactly cover the digits from 1 to 9 with no duplicates, and with each number appearing exactly once.
## Rows
all_digits = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]

Print all nine rows and row_missing_elements using the format:
row: [row], row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([row]) = [row_missing_elements]

Examples:
first_row: [1,0,3,4,5,6,0,0,9], first_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([1,0,3,4,5,6,0,0,9]) = [2,7,8]
second_row: [4,5,6,7,8,9,1,2,3], second_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([4,5,6,7,8,9,1,2,3]) = []
third_row: [7,8,0,1,2,3,4,5,6], third_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([7,8,0,1,2,3,4,5,6]) = [9]
fourth_row: [2,3,4,5,6,7,8,0,1], fourth_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([2,3,4,5,6,7,8,0,1]) = [9]
fifth_row: [5,6,7,8,9,1,2,3,4], fifth_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([5,6,7,8,9,1,2,3,4]) = []
sixth_row: [8,9,1,2,0,4,5,6,7], sixth_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([8,9,1,2,0,4,5,6,7]) = [3]
seventh_row: [3,4,5,6,7,8,9,1,2], seventh_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([3,4,5,6,7,8,9,1,2]) = []
eighth_row: [6,0,8,9,1,2,3,0,5], eighth_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([6,0,8,9,1,2,3,0,5]) = [4,7]
ninth_row: [9,0,2,0,4,5,0,7,8], ninth_row_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([9,0,2,0,4,5,0,7,8]) = [1,3,6]


## Columns
all_digits = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]

Format:
column: [column], column_missing_elements: [all_digits].difference([column]) = [column_missing_elements]

Examples:
first_column: [1,4,7,2,5,8,3,6,9] first_column_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([1,4,7,2,5,8,3,6,9]) = []
second_column: [0,5,8,3,6,9,4,0,0] second_column_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([0,5,8,3,6,9,4,0,0]) = [1,2,7]
third_column: [3,6,0,4,7,1,5,8,2] third_column_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([3,6,0,4,7,1,5,8,2]) = [9]
fourth_column: 

## Blocks
all_digits = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]

Format:
block: (rows: rows in the block; columns: columns in the block):
[block]
block_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([block]) = [block_missing_elements]

Examples:
top_left_block: (rows: first_row, second_row, third_row; columns: first_column, second_column, third_column)
[[1,0,3],
[4,5,6],
[7,8,0]]
top_left_block_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([1,0,3,4,5,6,7,8,0]) = [2,9]

[[0,0,9],
[1,2,3],
[4,5,6]]
top_right_block_missing_elements: all_digits.difference([0,0,9,1,2,3,4,5,6]) = [7,8]

# Finding and counting the zero elements
## The positions of the zeroes
For each row we do the following calculations:
row_unfilled_indices: [row].index(0) = [index of every '0' element in the row]
row_unfilled_positions: row_unfilled_indices.increment(1) = [each index incremented by 1]
row_unfilled_columns: the word versions of the positions of the zeroes

Use the following format:
first_row_unfilled_indices: [1,0,3,4,5,6,0,0,9].index(0) = [1,6,7]
first_row_unfilled_positions: first_row_unfilled_indices.increment(1) = [2,7,8]
first_row_unfilled_columns: second, seventh, eighth


## Calculate the number of unfilled squares
A simple one line calculation By Hand to get the total number of unfilled squares:
total_unfilled_squares = 3 + 0 + 1 + 1 + 0 + 1 + 0 + 2 + 3 = 11

Then we cap the number of squares to list:
number_of_squares_to_list = min(total_unfilled_squares, 17) = 11



# Candidate analysis
## Common candidates in each unfilled square
Go through each unfilled square and list the missing elements for the row, column, and block containing that square (use the row and column to get the correct block).
Calculate the elements that are in Both the row, AND the column. Make sure to find ALL of them.
Then calculate the elements that are in Both STEP_A (the previous result), AND the block. Make sure to find ALL of them.

Make sure to ONLY do unfilled squares, which we calculated in the section 'The positions of the zeroes'.
For each unfilled square we examine, we do the following calculations (example below):
STEP_A = row_missing_elements.intersection(column_missing_elements) = [elements in both row_missing_elements AND column_missing_elements]
STEP_B = STEP_A.intersection(block_missing_elements) = [elements in both STEP_A AND block_missing_elements]
common_missing_elements: [STEP_B]
FOUND: square(row, column) (print this line if there is Only one common_missing_element in that square, otherwise leave this line blank and keep going)

Example:
### first_row_unfilled_columns: second, seventh, eighth
#### 1 of {number_of_squares_to_list}
(first_row, second_column):
Using first_row_missing_elements, second_column_missing_elements, and top_left_block_missing_elements (do not list the elements here, just the set names)
STEP_A: [2,7,8].intersection([1,2,7]) = [2,7]
STEP_B: [2,7].intersection([2,9]) = [2]
common_missing_elements: [2]
FOUND: square(first_row, second_column) (If the square has one only one common_missing_element, also print "FOUND ONE: square(row, column)" like this, then keep going)

When we have done as many unfilled squares as specified by number_of_squares_to_list, we stop listing squares and print:
"Finished printing 17 out of 17 squares" (using appropriate numbers)

# Outputting the found squares
## Collating Results
For Every unfilled square that had ONLY one common element (marked with "FOUND: square(row, column)"), we list them below so they are all in one place.

FOUND: square(first_row, second_column)

Make sure to list ALL of them

If there where none, instead print "There were no unfilled squares with only one common_missing_element"


## Unbiased Results
Finally, for every square in the results, we need to list them in the following format:
square(first_row, second_column)
first_row_missing_elements = [2,7,8]
second_column_missing_elements = [1,2,7]
top_left_block_missing_elements = [2,7]

Note that neither of the output sections lists the common_missing_element found in that square. This is to allow unbiased verification of the results.

Make sure to list all of them

If there where none, instead print "There are no candidate squares"

Awaiting instructions.

prompt 7 of 7:
# Task and background
- My previous message contains the last few hundred characters of a Sudoku analysis.
- You are examining the results in the "Unbiased Results" section of the previous message. Ignore all text before that section.
- The cells given in the section "Unbiased Results" are cells which were found to have only one possible candidate.
- However, the process which found the given cells will sometimes make mistakes, due to having to check so many cells at once.
- Your task is to use the given instructions to perform an independent verification or rejection of the given cells.
- Detailed instructions are provided below, but an overview is as follows:
    - Calculate the possible candidate elements for each cell using the method given below.
    - If a cell has multiple candidates, or fails some other given condition, reject that cell as a mistake made by the previous process.
- Complete all steps starting at STEP_ONE.


# STEP_ONE Extracting Previous Results
- Extract the results of the "Unbiased Results" section in the previous message.
- If there is no section marked "Unbiased Results" in the previous message, that means the start of it was cut off. In that case just start with the first complete cell you can see.
- Only take at most the first FOUR cells of the "Unbiased Results" section, as that's all the system can handle.
- Print the text from that section under the current heading "STEP_ONE Extracting Previous Results". Do not print the heading from the previous message.
- Note: When you print the text, change '_missing_elements' to '_candidates' for the row, column, and block for every cell. Everything else should remain the same.
- These cells will be used in STEP_TWO.


# STEP_TWO Calculating the candidates of each cell
- For each cell from STEP_ONE, use the following method to calculate the candidates of that cell.
- For each cell:
    - Loop through the digits 1 to 9
    - For each digit, count the number of times that digit appears in the row_candidates list, the column_candidates list, and the block_candidates lists.
    - On the same line, sum the row count, the column count, and the block count to get the total_count.
    - Most importantly, if the total_count is 3, immediately print "FOUND A THREE".
- At the end of each cell, find all the digits which had a total_count of 3 (marked by FOUND A THREE) and list them as the candidates of that cell.
- Everytime you complete a cell print "Cell {current cell number} of {number of cells} complete! {number of cells left} more to go!"
- Then move to the next cell until all are done.
- If there are more than 4 cells, cap the number to check at 4.

- Here is an example with the correct format:
## Cell 1 of {number of cells}
cell(first_row, second_column):
row = first_row_candidates = [1,2,4,6]
column = second_column_candidates = [2,5,6,7,8,9]
block = top_left_block_candidates = [1,2,3,4,6,7]

row.count(1) = 1, column.count(1) = 0, block.count(1) = 1, total_count(1) = 2
row.count(2) = 1, column.count(2) = 1, block.count(2) = 1, total_count(2) = 3 FOUND A THREE
row.count(3) = 0, column.count(3) = 0, block.count(3) = 1, total_count(3) = 1
row.count(4) = 1, column.count(4) = 0, block.count(4) = 1, total_count(4) = 2
row.count(5) = 0, column.count(5) = 1, block.count(5) = 0, total_count(5) = 1
row.count(6) = 1, column.count(6) = 1, block.count(6) = 1, total_count(6) = 3 FOUND A THREE
row.count(7) = 0, column.count(7) = 1, block.count(7) = 1, total_count(7) = 2
row.count(8) = 0, column.count(8) = 1, block.count(8) = 0, total_count(8) = 1
row.count(9) = 0, column.count(9) = 1, block.count(9) = 0, total_count(9) = 1

Confirmed candidates found for cell(first_row, second_column): [2,6]
Cell 1 of 3 complete! 2 more to go!!!

- After you have done All of the cells, list them in one place.
- Example:
## Candidates of the cells
cell(first_row, second_column): [2,6]
cell(second_row, eighth_column): [9]
cell(fourth_row, second_column): [1]

- Make sure to list All the cells, up to a maximum of 4


# STEP_THREE Checking the number of elements in each cell
- For each cell, count the number of elements in the candidates of that cell using .length().
- After each length, either print "length is 1, Passes" if the length is 1, or print "length is {length}, not 1, Rejected" if the length is Not one.
- Example:
cell(first_row, second_column): [2,6]
[2,6].length = number from 2
length is 2, not 1, Rejected

- After doing this for all the cells, list the cells which Passed, making sure Not to list any Rejected cells.
- Example:
## Passing Cells
cell(second_row, eighth_column): [9]
cell(fourth_row, second_column): [1]


# STEP_FOUR: Grouping Cells with Corresponding Rows
- Group each cell from the "Passing Cells" in STEP_THREE with their corresponding row from the current Sudoku. Do not update them yet.
- If there are no passing cells to update, print "There are no cells to update" and move to the next step.
- The current Sudoku is the second message I sent. Since it's so far back print it here (in the exact format it appears but without the output tags) to avoid confusing it with the examples.

- Example:
Current Sudoku:
{Current Sudoku Goes Here}

first_row: [0,3,0,0,8,0,4,9,0]
cell(first_row, fourth_column): [5]

fourth_row: [0,4,1,6,7,3,2,5,8]
cell(fourth_row, first_column): [9]

seventh_row: [2,0,4,0,0,0,0,8,0]
cell(seventh_row, eighth_column): [3]


# STEP_FIVE: Applying Cell Updates to Rows
- Now that the cells to update are cleanly grouped with the appropriate rows, confirm the column position and update each appropriate row.
- However, and this is VITAL: If the column position does NOT have a zero, IMMEDIATELY reject that cell and move on to the next.

- Example:
first_row: [0,3,0,0,8,0,4,9,0]
cell(first_row, fourth_column): [5]
The 4th position of the first_row is 0, so we can proceed.
Updating the value in the 4th position of the first_row:
updated_first_row: [0,3,0,5,8,0,4,9,0]

fourth_row: [0,4,1,6,7,3,2,5,8]
cell(fourth_row, first_column): [9]
The 1st position of the fourth_row is 0, so we can proceed.
Updating the value in the 1st position of the fourth_row:
updated_fourth_row: [9,4,1,6,7,3,2,5,8]

seventh_row: [2,0,4,0,0,0,0,8,0]
cell(seventh_row, eighth_column): [3]
The 8th position of the seventh_row is 8, WHICH IS NOT 0. This cell is rejected and will not be updated.


# STEP_SIX: Printing the Updated Sudoku
- Now print the Sudoku using the updated rows
- Specify the rows to update first to be sure they aren't forgotten. Do not include any rejected cells.

- Example:
The rows to update are first and fourth
updated_first_row: [0,3,0,5,8,0,4,9,0]
second_row: [0,9,2,0,4,1,0,0,0]
third_row: [0,6,0,7,0,9,0,0,5]
updated_fourth_row: [9,4,1,6,7,3,2,5,8]
fifth_row: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3]
sixth_row: [7,8,0,0,5,2,6,0,0]
seventh_row: [2,0,4,0,0,0,0,8,0]
eighth_row: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,4]
ninth_row: [0,1,0,0,3,0,0,2,0]


# Standardizing Row Names in the Updated Sudoku
- Print the Sudoku you just updated, but with the the original NAMES for the rows.
- Make sure the elements are from the UPDATED Sudoku in STEP_SIX.
- As there is now an old and an updated Sudoku, both of which look similar, write the following above the updated Sudoku
"The rows to fix the NAMES of are {rows to change}. The elements are the same as in STEP_SIX."

- Example:
The rows to fix the NAMES of are first and fourth. The elements are the same as in STEP_SIX.

first_row: [0,3,0,5,8,0,4,9,0]
second_row: [0,9,2,0,4,1,0,0,0]
third_row: [0,6,0,7,0,9,0,0,5]
fourth_row: [9,4,1,6,7,3,2,5,8]
fifth_row: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3]
sixth_row: [7,8,0,0,5,2,6,0,0]
seventh_row: [2,0,4,0,0,0,0,8,0]
eighth_row: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,4]
ninth_row: [0,1,0,0,3,0,0,2,0]

- Do not modify any other names in the Sudoku.


# STEP_SEVEN: Shifting the Rows of the Sudoku
- Before you output the Sudoku, the top three rows need to shifted to the bottom, like cutting a deck of cards.
- The rows to be in the order: fourth, fifth, sixth, seventh, eighth, ninth, first, second, third.

- Example:
fourth_row: [9,4,1,6,7,3,2,5,8]
fifth_row: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3]
sixth_row: [7,8,0,0,5,2,6,0,0]
seventh_row: [2,0,4,0,0,0,0,8,0]
eighth_row: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,4]
ninth_row: [0,1,0,0,3,0,0,2,0]
first_row: [0,3,0,5,8,0,4,9,0]
second_row: [0,9,2,0,4,1,0,0,0]
third_row: [0,6,0,7,0,9,0,0,5]


# STEP_EIGHT Fixing the Row Names and Outputting the Sudoku
- WITHOUT moving the elements of the Sudoku, standardize the row names.
- Also surround the Sudoku in output tags to clearly mark it as the output.
- Do not write ANYTHING after the closing output tag, as it will interfere with the system extracting your output.

- Example:
<Output>
first_row: [9,4,1,6,7,3,2,5,8]
second_row: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3]
third_row: [7,8,0,0,5,2,6,0,0]
fourth_row: [2,0,4,0,0,0,0,8,0]
fifth_row: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,4]
sixth_row: [0,1,0,0,3,0,0,2,0]
seventh_row: [0,3,0,5,8,0,4,9,0]
eighth_row: [0,9,2,0,4,1,0,0,0]
ninth_row: [0,6,0,7,0,9,0,0,5]
</Output>


# Final notes
- Ensure all outputs are clearly labeled using the simple headers provided in the instructions.
- Do not use code blocks. Just plain text with the headers in the instructions is fine.
- Stop ONLY after completing STEP_EIGHT, writing NOTHING ELSE after you write the final closing output tag.
